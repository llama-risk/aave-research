- [\[Direct to AIP\] Onboard USDe November expiry PT tokens on Aave V3 Core Instance](https://governance.aave.com/t/direct-to-aip-onboard-usde-november-expiry-pt-tokens-on-aave-v3-core-instance/23013/4) - Supported the listing due to long maturity, strong demand for Ethena assets, and healthy pool liquidity.
