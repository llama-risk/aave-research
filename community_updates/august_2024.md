## Upcoming Focus Areas

The main priority is to conclude our assessment and make recommendations for the WBTC custody changes. The proposed BUILD GSM integration with Blackrock is also a key area of interest; we are exploring the legal implications and opportunities for growth integrating RWAs.  

Other areas of research include:
- GHO user analytics: researching the user profile of GHO to gain insights into adoption trends, collateral usage, user portfolios, and cross-protocol activity  
- Tooling for historical slippage at different swap sizes
- Research on the safe level of asset-specific capitalization for umbrella 
- Slashing simulation, which we intend to open-source
- Monitor bot for RWA redemption buffer
- Further research on supply cap limits (l2 concentration) and usage of cross-chain liquidity for liquidations

We welcome community feedback and suggestions. Please share any questions, ideas, or areas where you would like increased focus from the LlamaRisk team.
