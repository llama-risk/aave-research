### Recommendations and inputs

#### Asset onboarding
- [\[ARFC\] Onboard frxUSD and sfrxUSD to Aave v3 on Sonic Instance](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboard-frxusd-and-sfrxusd-to-aave-v3-on-sonic-instance/21768/6) - Did not recommend onboarding due to missing recent audits, absence of a bug bounty program, lack of transparency in sfrxUSD’s yield allocation, among other concerns.

- [\[ARFC\] Add PEPE to Aave V3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-pepe-to-aave-v3/22024/8) - Assessed the asset as onboardable with conservative parameters, while highlighting key reputational and strategic considerations for the DAO.
- [\[ARFC\] Onboard osGNO to Aave v3 Gnosis Instance](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboard-osgno-to-aave-v3-gnosis-instance/22033/3) - Recommended onboarding with noted concerns around concentrated DEX liquidity, inactive bug bounty, and lack of timelock on upgrades.
- [\[ARFC\] Onboard USDe July expiry PT tokens on Aave V3 Core Instance](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboard-usde-july-expiry-pt-tokens-on-aave-v3-core-instance/22041/4) - Supported onboarding given the relatively long maturity horizon and sustained yield incentives from Ethena's ongoing points program.
- [\[ARFC\] Onboard eBTC on Aave v3 Base Instance with CbBTC Liquid E-Mode](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboard-ebtc-on-aave-v3-base-instance-with-cbbtc-liquid-e-mode/21918/2) - Did not recommend onboarding due to severely low eBTC liquidity on Base.

#### New chain
- [\[ARFC\] Deploy Aave v3 on Tron](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-aave-v3-on-tron/21924/3) - Supported deployment with asset recommendations and **successfully advocated for an increased bug bounty payout** [following discussions with the TRON team](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-aave-v3-on-tron/21924/5). 

#### GHO related
- [\[ARFC\] GHO Cross-chain Parameter Adjustments](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-cross-chain-parameter-adjustments/21950/3) - Supported the proposal to raise the GHO CCIP rate limit on Base, noting it poses no immediate risks to GHO’s secondary market peg.

#### E-modes
- [\[ARFC ADDENDUM\] Modify E-Modes for PT Token Collateral](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-addendum-modify-e-modes-for-pt-token-collateral/22128/3) - Supported adding dedicated E-Modes for PT tokens and their underlying assets to enhance yield-leveraging utility without altering risk, while aiding smoother maturity migrations.

Phase 2](https://governance.aave.com/t/direct-to-aip-aave-chainlink-svr-v1-activation-phase-2/21940/4) - Proposed USDC as a new SVR asset on Prime, while supporting BTC-correlated assets on Core and ETH-correlated assets on Prime for SVR inclusion.
