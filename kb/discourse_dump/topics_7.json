This event represents the most substantial de-pegging observed since the token\u2019s inception. The decline is attributed to a liquidity drain from the main pool, Uni V3 GHO/USDC. Although prices have since rebounded, the issue of liquidity inadequacy necessitates careful consideration.\nPrice Analysis\nAt 9:15 AM UTC, the GHO token encountered an abrupt price decline, reaching a low of $0.946. Subsequently, it has rebounded to its pre-drop price level.\n\nSince its inception, GHO has generally traded below its peg, though consistently above $0.96. The recent price dip has led to an unprecedented low for GHO, well below its previous trading levels.\n\nLiquidity Analysis\nThe primary liquidity pools for GHO are Uniswap V3 and Balancer. However, due to the pool\u2019s composition on Balancer compared to the higher liquidity concentration on Uni V3, the primary source of liquidity has been the Uniswap pool.\n\nBalancer pool composition\n\nUniswap GHO/USDC pool liquidity concentration on 26.10\nUntil September 23rd, over $2.7 million worth of USDC tokens were locked in the GHO/USDC pool. However, in the subsequent two weeks (between September 23rd and October 6th), approximately $2.5 million in USDC tokens were withdrawn from the pool, primarily through a combination of liquidity removal from LP positions and GHO-to-USDC swaps. This trend of decreasing liquidity persisted over the following weeks, and by October 17th, it had fallen below 100,000 USDC. This period was marked by heightened price volatility, culminating in today\u2019s significant price drop.\n\nUniswap V3 GHO/USDC pool\n\n\nConclusion\nThe consistent withdrawal of USDC from the Uniswap V3 pool has led to a significant decline in GHO\u2019s price, reaching its lowest point since its inception.

Supply and demand for liquidity are balanced dynamically via utilization based interest rate models (IRMs), where the cost of borrowing (and return on lending) increase as more liquidity is withdrawn from the pools. This helps ensure that lenders have adequate liquidity to be able to withdraw their funds on demand, by incentivizing borrower repayments and new deposit inflows in cases where liquidity falls to low levels.\nMost IRM mechanisms use a \u201cjump rate model\u201d, where borrowing rates rise slowly up to an optimal utilization level, and then increase rapidly as utilization increases above the optimal point towards 100%. In normal conditions changes in utilization have a limited impact on borrow rate volatility, while the steep \u201cslope\u201d of borrow rates over the optimal point offer strong assurance against illiquidity risk.\nHistorically, these rate models have remained mostly static despite significant changes in market conditions. For example, in the height of the bull market, borrow rates frequently found equilibrium at high levels above the optimal utilization point, while in the bear market they have settled far below the optimal utilization point.\nLenders earn a return proportionally to both the interest rate paid by borrowers and utilization rate of the pool as a whole, meaning that the overall efficiency of peer to pool lending markets is maximized when utilization is at relatively high levels, typically around the optimal utilization point. The lack of adaptive updates to rate models therefore represents a missed opportunity to improve money market efficiency and welfare of borrowers, lenders, and the protocol as a whole.\nDesign Goals\nAs discussed above, static utilization based IRMs have significant drawbacks in terms of market inefficiency and user welfare. A mechanism design solution to these drawbacks should fulfill the following criteria:\n\nMaintain market safety by mitigating illiquidity risk\nImprove market efficiency, as measured by the spread between supply and borrow rates\nLimit governance workload and requirements for active management\nMinimize interest rate volatility\n\nBelow we describe one solution to optimize IRMs which addresses the key weaknesses of existing static models, while minimizing ongoing management and governance complexity.\nMechanism\nThe proposed mechanism adds a simple controller to the traditional utilization based IRMs. This allows for borrow rates to be adjusted to target the market utilization around the optimal level, automatically adapting to changes in equilibrium borrow rates without requiring active governance. Over time this should result in better market efficiency and narrower spreads between supply and borrow rates.\nThe core utilization based IRM remains broadly unchanged from existing lending protocols. Borrower interest rates are determined by a two part linear function, with interest rates at 0% utilization starting at a low base value, scaling up slowly towards an optimal interest rate at a selected optimal level of utilization, and then increasing rapidly to a high maximum interest rate as utilization increases beyond optimal levels towards 100%.\n\nA controller adjusts the interest rate at optimal utilization, and potentially also the base interest rate, depending on realized utilization levels over the prior period. Utilization levels can be determined implicitly based on past period realized borrow rates, which in turn are measured by comparing current supplier token (hereafter called cToken) exchange rate to its underlying asset versus the exchange rate at the beginning of the period.\nIn cases where utilization is higher than target, interest rates are increased to encourage additional deposits or loan repayments. If utilization is below target, borrow rates are reduced to encourage additional borrowing or withdrawals of excess liquidity. Over time this should lead to utilization more closely adhering towards the optimal point, leading to improvements in market efficiency without compromising on liquidity risk.\n\nEfficiency score noted above is a composite value determined based on the relative and absolute spreads between supply and borrow rate at a given utilization, and recognizes that users benefit from each of these values being minimized as much as possible. The score is calculated as supply rate as a share of borrow rate (1 minus the relative spread), divided by the absolute spread. We can see that this measure of efficiency is maximized at or slightly below the optimal utilization rate of a market.\nController Parameters\nThe controller has several parameters that must be selected by protocol governance. This includes the time period where past rates are evaluated and IRM adjustments are made, and the degree of rate adjustments when utilization is above or below target.\nBecause the maximum borrow rate at 100% utilization is intended to be high enough to ensure that markets don\u2019t remain illiquid for prolonged periods, it generally should not be necessary to adjust this rate via the controller. However, in cases where it is technically simpler to have the maximum rate shift on a one for one basis with optimal borrow rate (eg. due to the max rate being calculated based on a premium vs the optimal borrow rate), this should not cause any negative impacts.\nFor many peer to pool money markets, the base rate at 0% utilization is set as 0% borrowing cost, and in these cases it should not be necessary to adjust base rate via the controller as utilization should trend towards optimal rates regardless. For markets with non-zero base rate, it may be necessary to make controller adjustments to this rate to ensure there is sufficient slope between the base and optimal borrow rates to allow for price discovery.\nThe controller has the following parameters:\n\nUpdate frequency: determines length of time where interest rate and utilization levels are evaluated, as well as the frequency of adjustments to the interest rate model (minimum time period that must elapse between updates)\nMax target utilization: the maximum targeted level of market utilization, above which interest rates are progressively increased to encourage deposits or repayments\nMin target utilization: the minimum targeted level of market utilization, below which interest rates are progressively reduced to encourage additional borrowing\nOverutilization adjustment: degree of increase to interest rates when utilization exceeds maximum target\nUnderutilization adjustment: degree of reduction to interest rates when utilization falls below minimum target\nRate floor: absolute minimum rate(s) able to be set by the controller\n\nWhile exact settings for the controller are open to refinement, the below reference parameters should fulfill the overall design goals for the mechanism.\n\nUpdate frequency: 1 day\nMax target utilization: equal to optimal utilization ratio of the market\nMin target utilization: optimal utilization ratio minus 20% (eg, 60% min target utilization if market has optimal utilization ratio of 80%, or 25% min target utilization for markets with optimal utilization ratio of 45%)\nOverutilization adjustment: increase interest rates by 0.2%\nUnderutilization adjustment: reduce interest rates by 0.1%\nRate floor: 50% of initial optimal borrow rate determined by governance (eg 2% for Aave stablecoins)\n\nIn effect, if the increase in value of cTokens over the preceding period indicates a weighted average utilization outside the min or max target utilization rates, then the interest rate model is updated according to the underutilization or overutilization adjustment parameter.\nWhenever a rate adjustment is made, the controller must recalculate the supply rate that corresponds to optimal utilization levels to ensure that future period adjustments accurately reflect market conditions.\nDerivation and Examples\nWe denote the exchange rate of supplier tokens to underlying assets at time t as V(t). The supplier interest rate Rs over a given time period p can be calculated based on the length of time in the period, and relative exchange rate of lending tokens to underlying at times t-p and t.\nRs(t) = (V(t) / V(t-p)) ^ (1 year / p)\nIf p is 1 day, and the exchange rate of supplier token to underlying has increased from 1 to 1.0001 over the period, then the equation would be filled in as follows:\nRs(t) = (1.0001 / 1) ^ (365 / 1) \u2248 1.037 = 3.7%\nGiven a realized geometric mean supply rate over the period, we must determine whether it corresponds to a utilization ratio above the max target utilization, below the min target utilization, or within the target utilization range. We can do this by referencing the supply rate against market parameters set at the beginning of the sample period.\nLet the borrow rate at time t equal Rb(t), utilization rate of the pool equal U, and reserve factor equal F. This yields the following equation relating supply rate to utilization.\nRs(t) = Rb(t) * (1 - F) * U\nNow, we simply calculate the supply rate at the min and max target utilization ratios based on market parameters at the beginning of the period. For example, if a market has a reserve factor of 10%, optimal utilization ratio of 80%, base borrow rate of 0%, and optimal borrow rate of 4%, then using the example controller parameters from the previous section we would need to calculate supply rate at 60% utilization (min target) and 80% utilization (max target).\nMax target utilization: Rs = [(0.04 - 0) * (0.8 / 0.8)] * (1 - 0.1) * 0.8 = 0.0288 = 2.88%\nMin target utilization: Rs = [(0.04 - 0) * (0.6/0.8)] * (1 - 0.1) * 0.6 = 0.0162 = 1.62%\nSo, if the realized geometric mean supply rate is below 1.62% over the period, the interest rate model would be adjusted according to the underutilization adjustment parameter, and if mean supply rate is above 2.88% the rate model would be adjusted according to the overutilization adjustment parameter.\nContinuing the above example, let\u2019s assume that realized geometric mean supply rate was 3%, indicating utilization above target. The rate model would be adjusted to increase optimal borrow rate by 0.2% to 4.2%. New supply rates corresponding to min and max target utilization ratios would now be calculated based on the updated rate model.\nMax target utilization: Rs = [(0.042 - 0) * (0.8 / 0.8)] * (1 - 0.1) * 0.8 = 0.03024 = 3.024%\nMin target utilization: Rs = [(0.042 - 0) * (0.6/0.8)] * (1 - 0.1) * 0.6 = 0.01701 = 1.701%\nAt the end of the next period, these updated supply rate values would be used to determine whether utilization was above or below target.\nImplementation\nOwnership of or permissions over the relevant interest rate model(s) would be granted to a controller, which itself would be owned by the protocol governance. The controller would store values for supply rates corresponding to min and max target utilization ratios, as well as the exchange rate between cToken and underlying token, and time the last update was triggered.\nAfter at least as much time as the selected period has elapsed since the last controller update, anyone would be permitted to call the controller contract to trigger an update. The controller would record the current time and new cToken to underlying exchange rate, and then compare against the previous stored time and exchange rate to calculate the geometric mean supply rate over the period. It would then compare this realized supply rate against the stored supply rates corresponding to min and max utilization ratios to see whether it is within or outside of the target range.\nIf the realized supply rate indicates utilization is within the target range, no further action is needed. The controller would store the new timestamp while retaining the previously stored min and max supply rates. This would reset the countdown before a new update becomes possible, after the given period time frame has elapsed.\nIf realized supply rate indicates utilization is outside of the target range, then the controller would trigger an update to the interest rate model according to the relevant underutilization or overutilization adjustments. Based on the resulting rate model parameters, the controller would recalculate the supply rates corresponding to min and max target utilization ratios, and store these values along with the new timestamp.\nGovernance would have the ability to update controller parameters to optimize the rate model automation scheme based on growing familiarity with the mechanism or changing market conditions. Alternatively, governance could deauthorize the controller and return to a manual rate model parameter setting framework.\nGeneral Notes\nTo maintain gas efficiency and avoid burdening users with additional state updates, controller updates would be handled separately from standard market interactions. In some cases this could result in the controller not being updated for an extended time frame far longer than the given minimum update period. If the utilization ratio has been within the target range for a long period of time, then deviations from the range may not be immediately recognized until the controller has undergone a new update cycle. Because market liquidity is primarily ensured via the steep slope between optimal and maximum borrow rates, this should cause minimal disruption or reduction in the mechanism\u2019s efficacy. Protocols could consider engaging with an in house or decentralized keeper network to encourage more regular controller updates.\nUse of geometric mean of realized supply rates to assess utilization, alongside a \u201cjump rate\u201d style interest rate model with high maximum borrow rate, results in asymmetric adjustments to deviation from target utilization range. This can be demonstrated via an example: consider a market with 0% base rate, 4% optimal borrow rate at 80% utilization, and 50% maximum borrow rate. If the market reached 100% utilization for at least 6.5% of the given period, this would ensure an overutilization adjustment in the controller regardless of how low utilization (and supply rate) were for the remainder of the period. In a slightly less extreme example, utilization reaching 85% for as little as 25% of a given period would ensure an overutilization adjustment even if utilization was 0% for the remainder of the period. This is arguably a feature and not a bug, as conservative management of optimal rates to ensure market liquidity also has the beneficial side effect of strongly curtailing interest rate volatility. Over time this can be expected to improve borrower user experience.\nThis paper discusses rate model controllers in the context of standard interest rate models with explicit borrow rate curves and implied supply rates, used in Aave v2 and v3 as well as Compound v2. In principle it could also be easily adapted to markets with explicit supply rate curves such as Compound v3. In this case supply rate could be directly related to utilization, rather than via calculations as is the case with classical borrow rate models.\nConclusion\nThe above mechanism is able to achieve the stated design goals with minimal technical complexity or governance workload. This will allow liquidity protocols to improve market efficiency while freeing up governance and service provider workflows to address more complex, higher value goals. It offers a path towards greater automation of liquidity protocols, which in the long run can bring the benefits of greater decentralization and resilience.\nWe at Block Analitica look forward to sharing more on this and other mechanism design improvements for liquidity markets in the coming months.

Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet\u2019s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the Gauntlet Ethereum Aave V3 Risk Dashboard cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.\nFor more details, please see Gauntlet\u2019s Parameter Recommendation Methodology and Gauntlet\u2019s Model Methodology.\nSupporting Data on Ethereum Aave V3\nTop 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive aggregate positions on 2023-06-25\n\nTop 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive borrowers\u2019 entire supply on 2023-06-25\n\nTop 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive borrowers\u2019 entire borrow on 2023-06-25\n\n\nTop 10 non-recursive suppliers of DAI on 2023-06-25\n\nTop 10 non-recursive suppliers of USDC on 2023-06-25\n\nTop 10 non-recursive suppliers of WSTETH on 2023-06-25\n\nSupporting Data on Arbitrum Aave V3\nTop 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive aggregate positions on 2023-06-25\n\nTop 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive borrowers\u2019 entire supply on 2023-06-25\n\nTop 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive borrowers\u2019 entire borrow on 2023-06-25\n\n\nTop 10 non-recursive suppliers of LINK on 2023-06-25\n\nSupporting Data on Aave V2\nTop 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive aggregate positions on 2023-06-25\n\nTop 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive borrowers\u2019 entire supply on 2023-06-25\n\nTop 30 non-recursive and partially-recursive borrowers\u2019 entire borrow on 2023-06-25\n\n\nTop 10 non-recursive suppliers of CRV on 2023-06-25\n\nTop 10 non-recursive suppliers of SNX on 2023-06-25\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nRisk Dashboard\nGauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology\nGauntlet Model Methodology\nBy approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.", "reads": 61, "readers_count": 60, "score": 3232.2, "word_count": 1682, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/chaos-labs-mai-depeg-update", "topic_id": 14108, "title": "Chaos Labs - MAI Depeg Update", "posts_count": 1, "views": 1271, "like_count": 3, "author_username": "ChaosLabs", "created": "2023-07-23T19:48:36.178Z", "text": "Overview\nOver the past 24 hours, MAI has experienced high volatility, with prices reaching a low of nearly 0.91$.

This will enable Balancer linear pools to deposit wMATIC into Aave Protocol.\n\nAbstract\nWith strong deposit flows from the Balancer bb-a-wMATIC integration and the continual growth of the yield maximising strategy, the Supply and Borrow Cap of wMATIC are both experiencing strong utilised.\nThis publication enables the continued growth of wMATIC deposits as Balancer Liquidity Providers migrate to the new gauges and users continue to migrate from Aave v2 to v3. As wMATIC deposits grow so does the demand for borrowing wMATIC. Subsidised borrowing costs of wMATIC has lead to significant demand for wMATIC and TVL growth for Aave.\nIncreasing the Supply and Borrow Caps as outlined in this publication will continue to provide confidence to builders who are providing tooling to automate the management of yield maximising strategies.\n\nMotivation\nWith several Balancer liquidity pools depositing wMATIC into Aave v3 on Polygon, the utilisation of the Supply Cap has increased to 100%. This is currently preventing the Balancer linear pools from depositing into the wMATIC reserve.\nCurrently, there is around 5,294,939 and 1,228,487 units of wMATIC not yet migrated to the new gauges. The wMATIC Supply Cap is at 100% utilisation. This prevents the Balancer Linear Pools from depositing into wMATIC Reserve.\nThere is also 15.13M units of wMATIC on Aave v2 that has not yet migrated to v3.\nCollectively, this represents around 21.65M units of wMATIC relative to a Supply Cap. This publication intends to provide sufficent capacity for the 21.65M units to be deposited into the wMATIC reserve by increasing the Supply Cap from 66M units to 90M units, a 24M unit increase. The utilisation of the pool will be 73.33% after the Supply Cap is implemented.\n\nWith several teams offering yield maximising strategies, despite the large inflow of wMATIC deposits, demand for wMATIC has continued to grow. The current Borrow Cap has reached 74.50% utilisation. The newly proposed Borrow Cap 50M units is equivalent to 25% increase and represents 62.5% of the Supply Cap.\n\nWith reference to the new ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework it is possible to ship several upgrades to gradually increasing Aave\u2019s exposure to wMATIC over time.\n\nSpecification\nThe following risk parameters have been proposed by @Llamaxyz for the community to review and discuss in the comments section.\nTicker: wMATIC\nContract: polygon: 0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nCurrent Value\nProposed Value\n\n\n\n\nSupplyCap\n66.00M units\n90M units\n\n\nBorrowCap\n39.95M units\n50M units\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.", "reads": 40, "readers_count": 39, "score": 293.0, "word_count": 742, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/arc-gauntlet-recommendations-for-lusd-eth-v3", "topic_id": 13039, "title": "[ARC] Gauntlet Recommendations for LUSD ETH v3", "posts_count": 6, "views": 1096, "like_count": 1, "author_username": "seawolf", "created": "2023-05-10T03:42:39.817Z", "text": "\nSimple Summary\nThe supply and borrow caps have been exceeded by the following asset, surpassing the 75% threshold.\n\nLUSD borrow cap (79%) on ETH v3.\n\nIn accordance with our Borrow and Supply Cap Methodology, Gauntlet would like to raise the cap of the above asset to the following:\n\nIncrease LUSD Borrow Cap to 4M on ETH v3.\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nETH v3\n\n\n\n\nAsset\nCurrent Cap\nBorrow Cap Recommendation\n\n\n\n\nLUSD\n2.4M\n4M\n\n\n\n", "reads": 23, "readers_count": 22, "score": 174.6, "word_count": 343, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/arfc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v3-avax-2023-05-11", "topic_id": 13059, "title": "[ARFC] Risk Parameter Updates for Aave V3 AVAX 2023-05-11", "posts_count": 1, "views": 972, "like_count": 0, "author_username": "tuanyuan2008", "created": "2023-05-12T04:44:45.443Z", "text": "\nSimple Summary\nA proposal to adjust one (1) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Bonus, across one (1) Aave V3 AVAX assets.\n\nDecrease WBTC.e Liquidation Bonus from 106.25% to 105.9%.\n\nGiven that these changes above are relatively minor, we will not move forward with these changes in order to reduce governance overhead, unless the community voices otherwise.

Based on our analysis, we recommend increasing the Loan-To-Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold (LT) for WBTC and DAI, as we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support significant liquidations. Similarly, we recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty for WBTC, which is set conservatively at 10% to a lower level (8.5%) closer to that of USDC and Ethereum (5%).\n\nPositions Analysis\nWe have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations. However, we should call out that  ~40% of the on-chain supply of WBTC on Optimism is currently held on Aave, which calls for some caution. We have already proposed and implemented an amendment to the supply cap to limit the concentration of liquidity on Aave.\nGiven the blue-chip nature of BTC/WBTC, we expect significant arbitrage buying pressure to offset any slippage that may be created by future liquidations of WBTC and, therefore, recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty even with the current significant liquidity concentration on Aave. We expect a lower LP to drive liquidators to liquidate positions in smaller portions, pacing the process and allowing the market more time to react.\n\nRecommendations\n\n\n\n\nAsset\nParameter\nCurrent\nRecommended\nChange\n\n\n\n\nWBTC\nLiquidation Threshold\n75%\n78%\n+3%\n\n\nWBTC\nLoan-to-Value\n70%\n73%\n+3%\n\n\nWBTC\nLiquidation Penalty\n10%\n8.5%\n-1.5%\n\n\nDAI\nLiquidation Threshold\n80%\n83%\n+3%\n\n\nDAI\nLoan-to-Value\n75%\n78%\n+3%\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and will follow up with a Snapshot vote in 5 days, barring community objection.", "reads": 50, "readers_count": 49, "score": 430.0, "word_count": 1887, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/gauntlet-recommendations-for-eurs-on-v3-polygon", "topic_id": 12798, "title": "Gauntlet Recommendations for EURS on V3 Polygon", "posts_count": 4, "views": 1221, "like_count": 0, "author_username": "seawolf", "created": "2023-04-18T00:19:38.415Z", "text": "\nGauntlet Recommendations for EURS on V3 Polygon\n\nSimple Summary\nAsset EURS borrow cap usage is at 89%.

While this method is conservative, it will increase supply and borrow caps across most assets where the cap is close to its full usage.\nSupply Caps\nDefinitions:\n\nCurrentSupplyCap - the current supply cap configured for the asset\nExtremeLiquidationAmount -  the amount eligible for liquidation given an extreme drop in the asset price using Chaos Labs\u2019 Risk Explorer. We define the \u201cextreme drop\u201d for different market cap classes as follows:\n\nSmall Cap (<$2B) - 50% drop\nMedium Cap ($2B-$20B) - 35% drop\nLarge Cap (>$20B) and Stables- 15% drop\n\n\nMaxAmountLiquidated  - the maximum amount that can be liquidated while keeping the slippage below the Liquidation Penalty\n\nFramework:\n\nEvaluate the ExtremeProfitableLiquidationRatio:\n\n\nThis ratio represents how many times the ExtremeLiquidationAmount can be profitably liquidated had it all been liquidated at once.

Several reviews are already underway to modify and enhance these curves, which will require further research and likely amended Borrow Cap proposals.\n\n\nGiven recent proposals on the forums to amend IR curves and respective UOptimal points, we recommend that new proposed borrow caps be set up to 0.55 * SupplyCap until our new methodology is published.", "reads": 59, "readers_count": 58, "score": 506.8, "word_count": 621, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/chaos-labs-supply-cap-methodology", "topic_id": 12842, "title": "Chaos Labs - Supply Cap Methodology", "posts_count": 3, "views": 1427, "like_count": 4, "author_username": "ChaosLabs", "created": "2023-04-21T14:53:23.622Z", "text": "\nExecutive Summary\nSupply caps were introduced in Aave V3 to mitigate the exposure to any particular token. Leveraging Chaos Labs\u2019 agent-based simulation environment, we introduce a new stress-testing framework for setting the supply cap for each token.\nStress testing is a technique used to evaluate the performance and resilience of a system under extreme or adverse conditions. Its objective is to identify potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities that may not be apparent under normal operating conditions. It is widely used by traditional financial institutions to stress test risk capital requirements: refer to pages 46 & 47 of the Basel III publication.\nAave\u2019s supply cap determines how much a token can be supplied to the protocol and, therefore, how much of it can be used as collateral. As the amount of debt collateralized by this token increases, the liquidity risk associated with this token increases. That is, in the event of a severe token devaluation, liquidators must sell the collateral token in exchange for the debt token. If liquidations are not profitable - e.g., due to large slippage on DEXes - liquidators might be unwilling to liquidate the underlying position, and the protocol may accrue bad debt.\nOur goal with stress testing is to leverage Chaos Labs\u2019 agent-based simulation environment to measure the potential accrual of bad debt in these situations. As we increase the amount supplied as collateral in our simulations, the slippage incurred by liquidators increases monotonically. Accordingly, the protocol\u2019s potential bad debt also increases monotonically:\n\nScreen Shot 2023-04-21 at 10.46.48 AM1380\u00d71048 94.4 KB\n\nWe stress-test each token against appropriate stress scenarios based on historical data, which are described below. We binary search for optimal supply caps, limiting protocol losses to some target loss K. Initially, we propose capping potential protocol losses to 0.1% of the safety module\u2019s funds, which currently equates to $400K U.S. dollars. In case this figure limits future supply cap increases, the community could decide on a different threshold.\nWe find that a comprehensive and transparent stress testing suite provides a valuable resource for the Aave protocol. We may continue to leverage these stress tests for other protocol risk parameters, using them in conjunction with our existing Value at Risk simulations.\nAs we continue to iterate on this stress testing framework by designing more comprehensive stress scenarios such as governance token auctions (i.e., MKR\u2019s black Thursday) or short-seller attacks (i.e., CRV\u2019s exploit in November of 2022), we will ensure Aave is more and more resilient to any hypothetical stress event.\n\nStress Scenarios\nOur stress scenarios are motivated by the various severe devaluations observed in 2022. As discussed in our paper, we bias our stress scenarios in favor of more recent events, given that price and liquidity trajectories within Crypto evolve rapidly.\nSimilar to the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing framework, we define Moderate and Severe stress scenarios. We further distinguish between stablecoins and non-stablecoins, given their unique price and liquidity profiles. The price and liquidity trajectories used in our simulations are gleaned from Reference Events: historical examples of the stress scenario we are testing for. These are outlined below, with some example tokens. Notice that the example tokens in the Severe category below are just illustrative examples.\n\nScreenshot 2023-04-17 at 10.28.09 AM3092\u00d7940 226 KB\n\nWe first define the lookback window for the reference event - e.g., May 7th to May 15th for the LUNA crash. We gather liquidity trajectories by considering all major on-chain liquidity venues for the referenced token:\n\nScreenshot 2023-04-17 at 10.32.42 AM1812\u00d7476 73.4 KB\n\nGiven the price and liquidity trajectories of these referenced tokens, we then scale the current price and liquidity of the test token:\n\nScreen Shot 2023-04-21 at 10.50.49 AM1442\u00d7408 58.3 KB\n\nWe simulate liquidations under these prices and liquidities given the current borrow and supply of the test token. We then set supply caps such that protocol losses are capped at K.\n\nSensitivity Analysis\nWe further perform some sensitivity analyses on the price and liquidity trajectories. Specifically, we subject each token to a stress test against a predefined reference price and liquidity trajectory. We then simulate protocol losses against scaled price and liquidity trajectories to examine the sensitivity of protocol losses to the speed of price and liquidity depreciation. This allows us to distinguish between riskier and safer assets and allows the community to express its risk appetite for different tokens.\nSuppose governance considers FRAX and CRV to be riskier assets, whereas USDC and LINK are safer. That is, we are willing to take more liquidity risk on USDC and LINK, given their expected utility to the protocol. We may then simulate protocol losses using each token\u2019s respective stress scenario and select the supply caps accordingly\n\nTokens with no Collateral\nTokens that are not used as collateral have negligible liquidity risk since they will not experience liquidations under duress. To ensure we still set sensible supply caps, we simulate protocol losses as if 25% of the token\u2019s supply is used as collateral, although this is not strictly necessary. In fact, we floor the \u201ccollateral usage\u201d of all tokens at 25%, to ensure that we do not set overly liberal supply caps for tokens that aren\u2019t yet used as collateral - given that collateral usage may fluctuate significantly over time.\n\nNew Asset Listings\nTo set supply caps for new listings, we plan to use the supply and borrow distribution from a similar asset or set of assets as a starting point for our simulations. Given a similar supply and borrow distribution, we then use the target asset\u2019s on-chain price and liquidity to run our stress tests.\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nLSDs\nFor LSDs, two primary scenarios are distinguished when running simulations for supply caps:\n\nFor LSDs with calculated price feed (e.g., MaticX), only the positions of LSD collateral against non-underlying asset borrows are considered, as no risk exists in the LSD/underlying asset positions. In this case, it is still recommended to set an upper bound on the supply cap at 50% of the total circulating supply of the LSD to prevent extreme counter-party exposure, even when no explicit risk is identified.\nFor LSDs bearing counter-party risk, for which oracles are calculated with market price, a depeg scenario including E-Mode positions is simulated (e.g., cbETH).\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Chaos Labs - LSD Methodology Update\nConcentration Risk Mitigation\nTo prevent over-concentration of a token\u2019s on-chain liquidity on Aave, we recommend capping the supply of each token at 50% of its total circulating supply on a given network.\nPrice Manipulation\nFor every asset, we measure the cost and feasibility of price manipulation attacks which are considered in our recommendations for setting supply and borrow caps.\nFor more information, please refer to the Chaos Asset Protection Tool post\n\nConclusion\nChaos Labs has developed a generalized stress testing framework for setting Aave\u2019s supply cap, which may be extended to other stress scenarios (e.g. specific LSD de-pegs, short-seller attacks, etc.) and used for other risk parameters.\nWe will continue to update the community on new additions to the stress testing suite to ensure the community that the protocol is resilient to a variety of adverse conditions.", "reads": 34, "readers_count": 33, "score": 3346.8, "word_count": 1535, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/gauntlet-market-alerts-april-2023", "topic_id": 12581, "title": "Gauntlet Market Alerts (April 2023)", "posts_count": 1, "views": 1025, "like_count": 3, "author_username": "seawolf", "created": "2023-04-03T01:27:23.164Z", "text": "\nwstETH Borrow and Supply Cap Notification\nGauntlet would like to inform the community that the usage rates for wstETH\u2019s supply and borrow cap on Arbitrum v3 are at 100% and 77.61%, respectively.

Shortly after its implementation, a single large account, 0xccfa0, used nearly all of the new supply capacity, borrowing 20,824.73 ETH against 24,169.87 cbETH of collateral. See the following graph for the change in cbETH suppliers over time:\n\nThe account in question is in e-mode, meaning its liquidation threshold is 93%. Currently, it is borrowing $38M of ETH against $45M of cbETH, resulting in a collateral ratio of 85%. This poses a significant risk to the protocol due to the low on-chain liquidity of cbETH relative to the size of this account. Presently, the 25% depth of cbETH liquidity stands at only 17,300 tokens.\nTo illustrate the potential risk posed by 0xccfa0\u2019s position, consider the following scenario:\nShould the value of cbETH temporarily fall in price against ETH by 9%, 0xccfa0 would become liquidatable. A liquidator would then have the opportunity to repay half of 0xccfa0\u2019s debt (10.4k ETH) in exchange for just under half of its collateral (11.4k cbETH). Currently, a sale of 11.5k cbETH would have a price impact of over 7% (likely higher in a depeg scenario due to concentrated liquidity near the current price ratio). Importantly, an additional 7% price drop could trigger a cascade effect, not only making 0xccfa0 insolvent but also putting many non-e-mode users at risk of liquidation or even insolvency.\nGauntlet\u2019s analysis shows that it would have been prudent to make the supply cap increase after the upcoming Shanghai upgrade, which is expected to improve liquidity for liquid staking derivatives like cbETH. To err on the side of caution, we would not recommend further supply cap raises until after the upgrade occurs. Moreover, it is important to note that the cbETH redemption mechanism is different from stETH, lacking a native buffering system for quicker withdrawals (see Gauntlet\u2019s previous analysis of stETH withdrawals). Based on Coinbase documentation, cbETH withdrawals may take weeks to months, which could lead to differences in liquidity immediately following the upgrade.\n\nNext Steps\nWith the supply cap currently at 100% usage, Gauntlet strongly recommends against any further cap increases. We will continue to monitor the position and asset, providing updates and recommendations as necessary. In light of the stETH depeg in June 2022, when the price of stETH fell by 7% against ETH before recovering, it is crucial to acknowledge that a 9% cbETH depeg, even if temporary, could trigger cascading liquidations with potentially severe consequences.", "reads": 44, "readers_count": 43, "score": 1228.8, "word_count": 497, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/arc-gauntlet-recommendations-for-wsteth-on-aave-v3-arbitrum", "topic_id": 12675, "title": "[ARC] Gauntlet Recommendations for wstETH on Aave V3 Arbitrum", "posts_count": 6, "views": 1682, "like_count": 1, "author_username": "Pauljlei", "created": "2023-04-06T01:27:45.404Z", "text": "\nSimple Summary\nPer our Methodology, Gauntlet would recommend the following changes to the caps:\n\nIncrease wstETH Borrow Cap from 400 to 800.\n\nWhile our conservative rec is 2,800, we are limiting the change to 800, per community guidelines on increasing caps.\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, we do not recommend increasing the supply cap for wstETH and recommend a more conservative borrow cap increase at this time due to the impending Shanghai Upgrade.

While stablecoin E-Mode provides a strong competitive advantage, allowing very high leverage on stablecoins, it also encapsulates big risks.\n\nAlmost all of the bad debt on Avalanche during the USDC de-peg was caused by 3 large E-Mode positions.\n\nMitigating Stablecoin de-peg risk\nAAVE V3 provides a set of risk levers to control different aspects of risk. We have examined several alternatives to mitigate such shortfalls in the future while examining their impact both on risk and protocol reward:\n\n\nIncreasing Stablecoin Reserve Factor\n\n\nRemoving assets from the E-Mode category\n\n\nDecreasing E-Mode Category LT\n\n\nTight supply caps and/or borrow caps to limit exposure on E-Mode\n\n\nPlacing specific stablecoins in Isolation Mode (more on that on that soon)\n\n\nUltimately, we recommend increasing stablecoins\u2019 reserve factor as the most effective method to address stablecoin de-peg risk.\n\nIncreasing Stablecoins\u2019 Reserve Factor\nThe above are options to limit the risk exposure to stablecoin de-peg events. However, every risk management decision is essentially the valuation of risk vs. reward. By increasing the reserve factor of stablecoins, we seek to increase protocol revenue (reward) such that it will compensate for the de-peg risk.\nThe original documentation of AAVE V3 reads:\n\u201cThe Reserve Factor is a risk premium calibrated based on the overall risk of the asset. Stablecoins are the least risky assets with a lower reserve factor\u201d.\nThis holds for V2, where stablecoin borrows are treated equally to non-stablecoins, as there is no E-mode for increased capital efficiency. However, considering the increased risk exposure allowed by E-Mode, the risk premium should be higher.\nTo evaluate the increase in risk premium that needs to account for the increased risk in E-Mode due to de-peg events, we evaluate for an asset a:\n1. f(a) - The frequency of de-peg events per asset per year\n2. l(a)- The expected loss or bad debt in case of a de-peg event\nFor all assets in the category, we evaluate\n1. r - The revenues generated from borrowed assets\nThen we calculate the expectancy of annual loss from de-peg events:\n\nTo account for the loss, we increase the reserve factor of the stablecoins by the percent of the de-peg losses from protocol revenues.\n\nBy applying an increase in the reserve factor proportional to the loss amount, we compensate for the extra risk incurred by listing assets in E-Mode.\nNext, we will share a simulation-based evaluation of stablecoin de-peg risk losses and recommend the appropriate reserve factor settings. To get an intuition as to the amounts, the bad debt incurred by the recent USDC de-peg on AAVE V3 on Avalanche amounted to $260K, over 10% of the annual protocol revenues from stablecoin borrowing in E-Mode.\n\nScreen Shot 2023-03-16 at 17.43.441633\u00d7858 143 KB\n\n\nScreen Shot 2023-03-16 at 17.44.261578\u00d7859 73.7 KB\n\n\nOther Alternatives\n\nRemoving assets from the E-Mode category\n\nA potential solution is to remove certain assets from the stablecoin E-Mode category. Although this would eliminate any risk associated with the stablecoin\u2019s de-peg impact on E-Mode positions, it comes with significant drawbacks:\n\nDetermining which assets should or should not be included is challenging, as USDC was previously considered the safest centralized stablecoin until the SVB announcement.\nThis change will immediately affect E-Mode positions with this asset as collateral, as they will be subject to Non-E-Mode LT. Since E-Mode is commonly used to obtain high leverage, most positions are maintained with low health factors, making them susceptible to immediate liquidation.\nAave may lose its competitive advantage in offering high-leverage borrowing of pegged assets.\n\n\n\nDecreasing E-Mode Category LT\n\nReducing the E-Mode LT can enhance position sustainability during limited de-peg occurrences. Currently, with an LT setting of 97.5%, temporary deviations can lead to liquidations and bad debt since most E-Mode-managed funds have a low health factor below 1.1.\nNotably, the three significant positions responsible for the majority of bad debt during recent events on Avalanche would have faced liquidation with a de-peg of as little as 2.5%.\nWhile decreasing LT may trigger some liquidations, if done gradually, it will allow E-Mode position holders to adjust while incurring small amounts to be liquidated.\nThis action reduces leverage and may also decrease the stablecoin supply to Aave. Nevertheless, it still provides higher leverage than other protocols.\n\n\nUsing supply caps and/or borrow caps to limit E-Mode\n\nOne way to limit exposure to E-Mode is by limiting the supply or borrow caps of stablecoins. However, since the supply and borrow caps apply to all positions, this will decrease asset supply to Non-E-Mode markets. This, in turn, could severely affect the usability and revenue of the protocol, given that many positions involve stable<>crypto transactions.\nSetting stringent supply caps is akin to eliminating assets from E-Mode, as it restricts Aave\u2019s offering, losing its competitive edge. Therefore, if adopted, we must do so thoughtfully, such that the caps will mitigate fat-tail risk and contain the loss percentage from a de-peg while also allowing reasonable usage.\n\nConclusion\nE-Mode presents a higher leverage option, which comes with a new risk to the AAVE protocol. Currently, the risk of de-peg events is not factored into the protocol\u2019s risk settings. To address this, the anticipated loss from such events should be considered, and we propose increasing the Reserve Factor proportionally. This approach preserves AAVE\u2019s risk-reward balance and has fewer adverse effects than the alternatives.\n\nNext Steps\nWe invite the community to discuss the options presented above.

For many of the assets already listed, neither cap has been set. For those that have been implemented, there wasn\u2019t always a consistent methodology. Moreover, with the recent changes in market sentiment and volatility, there is a need to set forward a new, transparent methodology and process.\nIn the short term, we expect to iterate more frequently on setting supply and borrow caps while setting optimal thresholds. It will allow us to better identify and analyze market behavior following such changes, as we have already witnessed increased deposits in response to setting the supply cap on LINK.\nBorrow Cap References (from Aave docs and forum posts)\n\n\nBorrow caps can be used to prevent traditional and flash borrowing of an asset that may experience a price exploit and lead to protocol insolvency (link)\n\n\nTokens that are mainly used as collateral and have no obvious borrowing use cases usually should start off with a conservative borrow cap slightly above optimal utilization. With this, the asset can still be borrowed while limiting the exposure of the protocol (link)\n\n\n\nMethodology\nTo determine initial borrow caps, we\u2019re looking at several factors:\n\nThe optimal utilization rate (UOptimal)\nThe current supply of the asset (CurrentSupply)\nThe supply cap of the asset (SupplyCap)\n\nNote: UOptimal is a static 0.45 based on the interest rate curves currently approved. There are already several reviews underway to modify and enhance these curves, which will require further research and likely amended Borrow Cap proposals.\n\nThe rationale behind setting the caps\nWe want to accommodate all cases, including when the maximum amount is supplied (the supply cap). The ideal utilization in the case of maximum supply will be achieved at the optimal utilization ratio meaning SupplyCap * UOptimal. For instance, if the supply cap is set at 1,000 for token AAA and UOptimal is 0.45, a borrowing cap of 450 AAA tokens will suffice. This is because even if 1,000 AAA tokens are supplied, we can reach the optimal utilization point. Of course, most of the time, the supply will be lower. In this case, Slope 2 of the interest rate curve is supposed to help limit borrowing at CurrentSupply * UOptimal. However, as it takes time to adjust supply caps when nearing the cap, we also allow another 10% of the supply to be borrowed in case of high demand until the supply cap is raised.\nA temporary exception to this rule is when the amount of tokens already supplied to the protocol is already high. In this case, we understand that supply pressure pushes to increase the supply cap, so we allow for a somewhat higher borrow cap for the asset to accumulate demand ahead of the supply. This cap is at 70% of the current supply. Using the example above, where the cap on token AAA is 1,000, and there is already a supply of 900 AAA tokens, we\u2019ll set the cap to 0.7 * 900 = 630 AAA tokens. This is because we understand that under the current supply pressure nearing the cap, we\u2019re likely to review an increase in the supply cap (depending on risk concerns), and following also the borrowing cap.\nLevel 1 Borrow Cap =  SupplyCap * (UOptimal+0.1)\nThis theoretical limit still allows optimal asset utilization at the point of maximum supply. The additional buffer of 10% of the supply leaves room for more borrowing in case of high demand until the supply cap is raised.\nLevel 2 Borrow Cap = 0.7 * CurrentSupply\nIn cases where the current supply is nearing the existing supply cap, we want to allow for a higher borrow cap, as it is a signal of high supply that may likely result in increasing the supply cap. Higher borrow caps will leave space to identify increased demand to support such a decision. The borrowing cap is complementary to the interest rate curve, and the latter is the main mechanism to ensure sufficient liquidity on the supply side to allow aToken redemption both for suppliers to withdraw liquidity and to ensure efficient liquidations. At the same time, we seek to ensure sufficient liquidity for suppliers in case of surging demand from borrowers, so the lower bound is set at 0.7.\nThe recommended borrow cap should be the larger value between Level 1 and Level 2.\nThis is an initial iteration of the borrow cap methodology. We\u2019d love any community feedback or ideas on how to improve the methodology.", "reads": 85, "readers_count": 84, "score": 2632.0, "word_count": 1314, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/arc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-aave-v3-avalanche-2023-02-07", "topic_id": 11603, "title": "[ARC] - Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - Aave V3 Avalanche - 2023.02.07", "posts_count": 5, "views": 2497, "like_count": 15, "author_username": "ChaosLabs", "created": "2023-02-07T20:14:01.807Z", "text": "\nSimple Summary\nA proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus, across four (4) Aave V3 Avalanche assets.\n\nMotivation\nChaos Labs\u2019 Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different configurations of Aave V3 risk parameters would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt.\nNote: As a general guideline, we limit the search range to \u00b13% change for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal.

However, we do not think this poses a significant risk on account of the following:\n\nIf Aave borrowing APY < sAVAX Staking APY, then the price appreciation is greater than IR payments, and no liquidation will take place\nIf Aave borrowing APY > sAVAX Staking APY, then it will be unprofitable for sAVAX holders to borrow AVAX against sAVAX, as they\u2019d rather simply unstake their AVAX.\n\n\n\n\n\nNon E-Mode Liquidations\nOutside of E-mode, with the liquidation bonus set at 10%, liquidators may choose to seize sAVAX if an account\u2019s health dips below one and sell off the sAVAX with a higher profit margin than other collateral.

Under the current risk parameters of 30% LT outside of E-mode, we assume that sAVAX collateral increase will distribute similarly and may lean even more towards E-mode positions than the current supply. Under this assumption, even when we increase the supply cap by 100%, there is still enough liquidity to profitably liquidate 50% of the total positions that may be liquidated (outside of E-mode).\nWith these defensive assumptions, we recommend increasing the supply cap to 2M sAVAX.\n\nRecommendations\n\n\n\n\nAsset\nCurrent Supply\nCurrent Supply Cap\nRecommended Supply Cap\n\n\n\n\nsAVAX\n999,910\n1,000,000\n2,000,000\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Benqi is an existing customer of Chaos Labs\u2019 risk and optimization services which provides us further visibility and knowledge of risks related to sAVAX.

Projection Finance is an online tool that allows you to simulate the impact of price changes and actions on a portfolio of assets. The product is initially focused on the DeFi and cryptocurrency market, but it may be expanded to include other types of assets in the future.\nWe are seeking feedback from Aave V3 Avalanche users to ensure that Projection Finance is useful and easy to use for those who have positions on Aave V3. If you have positions on Aave V3 Avalanche and would like to try out Projection Finance, please do not hesitate to message us for more information.\nWe plan to open Projection Finance to all V3 markets, including Ethereum, as soon as the protocol is released. We believe that Projection Finance can be particularly useful for Aave users, as they will be able to create projection scenarios by modulating asset prices and know at what threshold they can be liquidated or simply see the evolution of their debt or supply over time and prices.\nWe hope that many of you will try out Projection Finance and give us your feedback. We are excited to work with you and improve the tool. If you have ideas for new features or encounter any issues while using Projection Finance, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are committed to making Projection Finance a useful and accessible portfolio simulation tool for all Aave users.\nIn addition to simulating the impact of price changes on your portfolio, we are also working on adding new features to Projection Finance. For example, we plan to add the ability to simulate actions such as borrow, supply, emode, and many more. We believe that these features will be particularly useful for Aave users who want to better understand how these actions can affect their portfolio.\nWe are excited to continue developing Projection Finance and adding new features to meet the needs of our users.

As a first step, the community has decided on the initial assets listed on this deployment.\nThe primary blocker to launching v3 Ethereum is the risk parameter configuration of the assets to be deployed. To provide parameter recommendations and enable the deployment at the earliest convenience, Chaos Labs suggests dividing the listing of assets into two stages.\n\nLaunch - Stablecoins and select \u201ctop-tier\u201d assets (full list and recommendations below)\nPost-Launch - rest of the assets as voted on here\n\nGiven Gauntlet\u2019s parameter recommendations for isolated long-tail assets, the community can decide to include them in the initial deployment stage. Chaos Labs will be able to provide our analysis and recommendations for these assets after launching the Parameter Recommendation Dashboard in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nChaos Labs is proposing the following framework for deciding on the initial parameter configurations of these assets and is inviting the community to provide feedback and input to incorporate into these initial recommendations.\n\nMotivation\nUnder the current market conditions and in light of the recent CRV attack, Aave aims to provide lenders and borrowers with enhanced security and risk measures via the Ethereum V3 deployment. Chaos Labs is building a set of agent-based simulations that will inform optimized risk parameters for V3 markets with the aim of:\n\nUnblocking other contributors in launching V3 on Ethereum.\nFacilitating a safe and guarded initial launch.\nRecommend parameters in-line with current market conditions and liquidity.\nIterate on recommended parameters to help incentivize users to migrate from V2 to V3, where more granular risk parameter tuning is available.\n\nOur V3 Monte Carlo simulation framework is expected to be completed in January 2023; however, due to the urgency of deploying Aave V3 on Ethereum, we have devised an interim methodology for initial launch risk parameters. Under current conditions, our risk-reward tradeoff leans heavily toward risk aversion; therefore, our primary motivation with the interim methodology is to provide a risk-off strategy for the community to opine on. Optimizing for risk-averse parameters while producing recommendations promptly has intentionally yielded less capital-efficient results. Once the simulation framework is complete and published for review, we can iterate on the recommendations to produce more capital-efficient risk parameter recommendations while keeping protocol risk at acceptable levels.\n\nMethodology\nSince Aave V2 on Ethereum has a long history and significant TVL and volume, the best approach for the initial recommendations is to use its risk parameter settings as a reference. Our approach is as follows:\n\nUtilize existing risk parameters as a baseline.\nAdjust parameters based on simulation results.\nIntroduce additional risk parameters to accommodate extra security measures.\n\nV3 offers a comprehensive set of risk parameters - some available on V2 (LT, LTV, Liquidation Penalty). We start by replicating the existing V2 parameters, adjusting them, and adding new ones (Supply Cap, Borrow Cap). After that, we will examine how we can use additional V3 risk levers and modes (efficiency mode, isolation mode) to make the assets more efficient via parameter updates, unfreezing assets, and enabling borrows.\n\nTLDR - Initial Set Results\n\n\n\n\nAsset\nSupply Cap\nBorrow Cap\nLT\nLTV\nLiquidation Bonus\nDebt Ceiling\n\n\n\n\nWBTC\n43K\n28K\n75%\n70%\n6.25%\nN/A\n\n\nWETH\n1.8M\n1.4M\n82.5%\n80%\n5%\nN/A\n\n\nwstETH\n200K\n3K\n79.5%\n68.5%\n7%\nN/A\n\n\nUSDC\n1.76B\n1.58B\n76%\n74%\n4.5%\nN/A\n\n\nDAI\n338M\n271M\n77%\n64%\n4%\nN/A\n\n\nLINK\n24M\n13M\n65%\n50%\n7.5%\nN/A\n\n\nAAVE\n1.85M\n0\n70%\n60%\n7.5%\nN/A\n\n\n\nIn addition, we recommend configuring an Ethereum-correlated (wstETH & ETH) e-mode category with the following parameters (more info on e-mode configuration below):\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nAssets included\nLT\nLTV\nLiquidation Bonus\n\n\n\n\nEthereum Correlated\nWETH, wstETH\n93%\n90%\n1%\n\n\n\n\nInitial Parameter Recommendation Process Overview\nThe Initial Assets List\nIn light of the urgency to transition to Aave V3, we have focused on a limited number of assets to ensure proper risk coverage. To drive the most impact, we have selected assets representing a significant portion of the protocol\u2019s usage (and, therefore, revenue).\nRisk Parameters that already exist on Aave V2\nFollowing the guidelines of our approach to start with the battle-tested parameters of V2, we begin with a baseline of LT, LTV, Liquidation Penalty, and IR Curve similar to the values set today for those assets on V2.\nSupply Caps for Non-Stable Crypto Assets\nThen, we determine the supply caps described in our supply cap methodology. Since the supply caps are derived from the liquidity available in DEXs to facilitate potential liquidations, it is essential to note that they should apply to the supply of both V2 and V3 for each asset. This is because we expect to see accounts from both V2 and V3 liquidated in cases of high market volatility, and the same DEX pools will be used to absorb the liquidated assets. However, the base assumption is without significant increases in rewards or yields, we don\u2019t expect to see significant net new liquidity in V3. Instead, as economic incentives align (improved capital efficiency in V3 versus V2), we expect the liquidity to originate from V2 as users migrate.\nTo ensure a significant V3 migration, we will recommend risk parameter changes shortly (see recommendations below) to incentivize users to transition to V3.\nSupply Caps for Stable Coins\nThe supply caps for stablecoins are derived from the number of stablecoins required to ensure the economic efficiency of the protocol, similar to V2. To do that, we examine the following:\n\nThe percentage of collateral each stablecoin represents from the total collateral supplied against non-stable crypto assets (that we choose to list on V3) borrows in V2. For example, consider all positions in which an asset is provided as collateral and assets such as WBTC or WETH are borrowed against the said stablecoins.\n\n\nimage1800\u00d71230 72.3 KB\n\nSource - Block Analitica - AAVE | Block Analitica\n\nThe percentage of borrows each stablecoin represents from the total borrows against collateral provided in non-stable crypto assets that we choose to list on V3. The following graphic illustrates this on a trailing 30-day basis:\n\n\nimage1800\u00d71204 61.3 KB\n\nSource - Block Analitica - AAVE | Block Analitica\nWe set the supply caps to sufficiently accommodate collateral and borrow against the listed non-crypto assets.\nStablecoins supplied as collateral for WBTC and WETH loans from Aave V2\n\n\n\n\nAsset\nAgainst WBTC Loans\nAgainst WETH Loans\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nUSDC\n$49.7M\n$94.6M\n$144.3M\n\n\nDAI\n$0\n$12.4M\n$12.4M\n\n\n\nStablecoins borrowed against WBTC and WETH collateral from Aave V2\n\n\n\n\nAsset\nAgainst WBTC Loans\nAgainst WETH Loans\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nUSDC\n$147.2M\n$185.7M\n$332.9M\n\n\nDAI\n$13.4M\n$36.5M\n$49.9M\n\n\nUSDT\n$62M\n$65.9M\n$127.9M\n\n\n\nObserving the current amounts of stablecoins borrowed or supplied against WBTC and WETH, we see the total amounts of stablecoins borrowed are significantly higher. Therefore they should serve as the reference to determine the supply caps of stablecoins. Although stablecoins generally do not contribute much to the risk of the protocol, it is better to set caps if they are such that they can assure proper utilization and efficiency.\nSince the only non-stable crypto assets listed initially are WETH, WBTC, and wstETH, we know that the borrows against WBTC collateral will be WETH, wstETH, and stablecoins, and conversely, borrows against WETH collateral will be WBTC, wstETH, and stablecoins.\nWe recommend setting the caps for stablecoins as the sum of their respective borrow amounts against WETH and WBTC on V2. Once deriving the estimated stablecoin amounts borrowed against WBTC and WETH on V3, we suggest setting the supply cap to the sum of the estimated quantities multiplied by UOptimal (the optimal utilization ratio) of the crypto asset. This way, in the event of max supply of both WETH and WBTC, there will be enough stablecoins to be borrowed while keeping each stablecoin\u2019s utilization rate at the optimal level.\n\nDenote amount of stables borrowed against WETH in v2 as Bv2(Stable, WETH)\n\nDenote LTV(Stable, WETH) = Bv2(Stable, WETH)/CollateralUSDValueV2(WETH)\n\nWe wish to maintain the same LTV(Stable, WETH) in v3, even when the WETH supply cap has been filled.\nThat yields LTV(Stable, WETH) = Bv3(Stable, WETH)/SupplyCapV3(WETH)\n\nTo support this amount of borrows and maintain optimal utilization, we must allow Supply(Stable) of at least Bv3(Stable, WETH)/U_{opt}.\nTherefore, we set Supply(Stable, WETH) = Bv3(Stable, WETH)/U_{opt} = Bv3(Stable, WETH)/U_{opt} = (LTV(Stable, WETH) * SupplyCapV3(WETH))/U_{opt}\n\n\nConversely, this holds for Supply(Stable, WBTC). Adding both terms together yields the following:\nSupplyCap(Stable) = Supply(Stable, WETH) + Supply(Stable, WBTC)\n\nLowering LT, LTV for Stablecoins\nDuring the last bull run, many risk parameters on AAVE V2 were relaxed significantly. Specifically, LTs, LTVs, and Liquidation Penalties of stablecoins and the major crypto assets are too high considering current market conditions.\nChallenges with Lowering LT, LTV\nIncreasing LTs enables additional borrows against the same collateral. This has no direct negative impact on users. However, lowering LT may cause loan liquidations that fall below the new lower LT. An example of this regarding USDC and DAI LTs was discussed recently after the CRV attack (link). Therefore, we believe that the best approach will be to launch AAVE V3 on Ethereum with conservative LT parameters and incrementally increase them over time rather than deploy with the current LT and LTV parameters.\nA conservative approach to setting LT, LTV for WETH, WBTC\nWBTC and WETH are highly liquid assets that lead the market, and their current LT and LTV levels are high, as they were set during different market conditions. As part of the general approach to start with conservative parameter settings, we recommend starting with conservatively low LT and LTV settings for those assets and increasing them over time. The method we chose to adjust the LT and LTV of non-stable assets is to use the LT, and LTV values of those assets on other V3 deployments, relying on the fact that it is derived from volatility and liquidity. Since the volatility of those assets is similar regardless of chain and liquidity is lower on chains of current V3 deployment, the values of LT and LTV will be conservative.\nThe approach to setting LT and LTV for Stablecoins\nLT, LTV, and Liquidation Penalty should be derived from the volatility of the collateral factor, i.e., the ratio between the loan\u2019s value and the collateral\u2019s value. When stablecoins are used as collateral, we assume that the collateral asset has near-zero volatility, so the LT and LTV should be derived from the borrowed asset\u2019s volatility. The intuition behind this is that if we set the LTs to be the same for all assets borrowed against a specific collateral asset (stablecoin), then highly volatile assets are more likely to fall quickly from a state where the loan is healthy to a state where it is defaulted and not profitable for liquidations.\nAAVE V3 provides a set of risk parameters to control this type of risk but not directly setting different LTs according to the borrowed asset. Therefore, setting LT and LTV for stablecoins will be determined in conjunction with the risk parameters of volatile assets that may be borrowed against them. Future parameter recommendations will derive these values from large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. To unblock the V3 deployment, we recommend starting with LT and LTV of stablecoins that will reflect the current composition of borrowed assets on V2.\nFor the initial parameter setting for V3, we recommend deriving the LT of each stablecoin from those of assets borrowed against it in V2, under the assumption that the transition of funds from AAVE V2 to AAVE V3 will not change the supply/borrow composition significantly. To this end, we have calculated the weighted average of LT of assets borrowed against USDC as collateral and against DAI as collateral separately. This is because it reflects the implied volatility behind loans that are taken against those assets. Once LTs are calculated, we set the LTV of DAI and USDC, keeping the same LTV/LT ratio of those assets on AAVE V2.\nGiven there are n assets Xi...Xn borrowed against a stablecoin S, where the dollar value of the amount borrowed in each asset is USDBorrow(Xi,S), and the LT of the borrowed asset is LT(Xi); we calculate the LT of stablecoin S as:\n\nimage1056\u00d788 7.5 KB\n\nRecommended LT, LTV Values for USDC and DAI\nBased on the methodology described above, we recommend setting the following initial parameters:\n\n\n\n\nAsset\nLT\nLTV\n\n\n\n\nUSDC\n76\n74\n\n\nDAI\n77\n64\n\n\n\n\nProposals for incentivizing and accelerating a V3 transition\nSuccessful migration of users to V3 will require economically aligning incentives for suppliers and borrowers. Since most initial risk parameters are similar in both versions, users are inclined to keep using V2 because it is more liquid. Moreover, launching the protocol with lower LTs for stablecoins will create a state where stablecoin suppliers are incentivized to use AAVE V2 over AAVE V3, as the LTs are higher.\nWe believe there are three main levers the protocol can utilize to expedite the transition:\n\n1. Incrementally Reduce LT and LTVs across active markets in V2\n\nWe\u2019ve previously written about this (here, here, and here) and have initiated this process via a batch of AIPs. Reducing LTs across V2 will ultimately help migrate users to V3, where they can reap the benefits of higher capital efficiency. Since lowering LTs can invoke liquidations, this needs to be done gradually over time, with ample notice for users so that they can wind down positions and, ideally, a clear roadmap communicated from the start.\n\n2. Freezing Markets Post V3 Launch\n\nAfter the CRV attack, a proposal was made to freeze most V2 markets. Chaos Labs, with Llama, proposed an alternative path forward aimed at neutralizing market risk more precisely while keeping healthier markets open. The primary rationale was that effective risk mitigation could be applied while not shutting down Aave for business. However, we support revisiting V2 asset freezing as said assets are activated on V3 with tighter risk controls. This is because we no longer harm user experience and limit optionality as users can opt to deposit and borrow on V3 while only withdrawing from V2.\n\n3. AAVE V3 Rewards to Incentivize Transition from AAVE V2\n\nLooking at previous deployments of new protocol versions of AAVE, we know that providing rewards to protocol users is a powerful and significant tool to encourage a timely migration.\nFor example, let\u2019s examine the deployment of AAVE V3 on Avalanche and Polygon. A sizeable reward program was deployed on Avalance, and in just one week, most funds shifted from V2 to V3. On Polygon, where there was no such reward program, V2 is still more than twice the size of V3, both in terms of market size and total borrows.\nA reward program was also put in place during the transition from AAVE V1 to V2 on Ethereum, and it is essential for the quick transition from V2 to V3. We will follow up with further thoughts on a reward program shortly.\n\nimage1800\u00d71035 137 KB\n\n\nimage1800\u00d71115 64.1 KB\n\n\nV3 Asset Risk Parameter Recommendations\n\nSupply Caps\n\n1.

Prices of other assets are highly correlated, as expected in such a scenario.\nFigures 1.2-1.4 show the ability to liquidate examined asset, WETH, given the price trajectory in figure 2.1. The orange line at the top is the maximum amount that can be liquidated profitably based on the estimated change in liquidity at time t, which we denote as $MaxDump(t)$. The blue line on the same plot is the projection of the liquidated amount in case the supply cap will be the current supply divided by r. This corresponds with the assumption that an increase in TVL towards the cap is distributed similarly to the current state, so we can expect liquidations to grow at the same rate.\nIn some cases, the amount eligible for liquidation cannot be entirely liquidated:\nAmountEligibleForLiquidation(t)/r < MaxDump(t)\nWe get debt(t) = AmountEligibleForLiquidation(t)/r - MaxDump(t), shown in the middle plot. If that amount is not liquidated over 3 minutes, the insolvable amount is bad debt (bottom plot). We wish to find minimal r such that BadDebt(t) = 0 , throughout the entire simulation. We scan over r in the range [0.2:1]. Below we show examples from this range:\n\nimage1800\u00d71229 259 KB\n\nFigure 1.2 - For r=0.2 (which yields a supply cap 5 times the current supply), There is an amount that cannot be liquidated.

We set the cap to be the current supply of WETH divided by 0.782.\n\nCalculating the Cap for WBTC:\nWe choose the minimal r value so that no debt is accrued throughout the simulation. That means the liquidity in the examined scenario can support an increase of CurrentSupplyV2(WETH) by a factor of 1/r under the assumption that additional supply will have a similar distribution of health factor levels to that which we see on V2 today. We Calculate the supply cap for the examined asset:\nr =0.782\nSupplyCap(WBTC) = CurrentSupplyV2(WBTC)/r = 34K/0.782 = 43k\n\nimage1800\u00d71316 202 KB\n\nFigure 2.5 Sweep over r values.

We have currently set LowMarketCapTokenThreshold to 2 Billion USD.\nPutting it all together, for AAVE, we compute the following:\nMarketCapFactor = 800/2000 = 0.39\nr =0.435\nSupplyCap(AAVE) = CurrentSupplyV2(AAVE)/r *MarketCapFactor = 2.07M/0.435*0.39  = 1.85M\n\nimage1800\u00d71221 199 KB\n\nFigure 4.2 Sweep over r values.

In the worst case, where all positions are fully leveraged, an LT of 93% would guarantee an over-collateralization high enough to enable liquidations. LTV is set to 90%, a slightly higher margin than staked assets on other chains, as historically, we have seen daily price changes of 2.22%. This protects retail users and still allows 10x leverage.

With stETH supply on Aave v2 of over $1B this is a significant risk to the protocol.\nTo mitigate this risk, we recommend a relatively low borrow cap of 3,000 for stETH. Dumping this amount has a price impact of ~0.11, which allows a buffer for profitable liquidations, given the 1% liquidation bonus.\n\nAave V2 Liquidation Levels\n\nUntitled (12)1920\u00d7980 55.6 KB\n\nWe see a major account (health=1.18), that would fall under health = 1 if the price drops to 0.81 (If not rebalanced) - https://debank.com/profile/0x94269a09c5fcbd5e88f9df13741997bc11735a9c.

Supply caps are a crucial piece of risk management in V3 but will only be impactful once the usage of the respective asset in V2 is minimized.\nAssuming the rationality of borrowers and suppliers, the incentives must be aligned between the protocol and users to usher migration and deployment of new and existing capital to V3. While increasing capital efficiency (i.e., increased Liquidation Thresholds) on V3 immediately would attract new deposits and borrows, it also introduces increased risk, which we advise against during this transition phase. Instead, we propose an incremental plan involving reducing LT and LTVs incrementally on V2, as proposed here (AIP-136, AIP-137), while proposing attractive Interest Rate curves for V3 deployments, thus aligning economic incentives.", "reads": 95, "readers_count": 94, "score": 1234.0, "word_count": 4340, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v3-optimism-2022-12-29", "topic_id": 11213, "title": "[ARC]: Risk Parameter Updates for Aave V3 Optimism 2022-12-29", "posts_count": 8, "views": 3210, "like_count": 22, "author_username": "jmo", "created": "2022-12-29T22:00:13.773Z", "text": "\nSimple Summary\nA proposal to adjust one (1) total risk parameter - Supply Cap - across one (1) Aave V3 Optimism asset.\nThis should reduce risk in the protocol, though it could limit the growth of AAVE token deposits on Optimism.\n\nAbstract\nThere is currently not a supply cap for the AAVE asset on Aave\u2019s v3 deployment on Optimism. We are going to set this quickly and provide a deeper analysis of all of the current supply caps next week. We believe these could be more conservative, but setting a supply cap for AAVE sooner rather than later will reduce the chance of new positions creating a dangerous spike in VaR.\nBeyond this, the cap greatly reduces the viability of market downturn and price manipulation attacks involving the AAVE token.\n\nMotivation\nAny market without supply caps could experience an outsize risk by someone opening a very large position quickly. Maintaining supply caps that ensure that one user cannot subject the protocol to outsize risk is a key part of risk management for Aave v3 markets.\nGauntlet\u2019s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. This change was driven by analysis focusing on insolvency, as estimated by our simulations. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). The input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation.

The current AAVE supply on Optimism Aave v3 is $4.7M, so a liquidator will not be able to arbitrage a large AAVE position solely on Optimism DEXs. However, the liquidation bonus at 10% is high enough that we anticipate liquidators should be willing to hold or bridge AAVE. As the markets on Optimism grow, AAVE will rely more and more on the asset bridge and available cross-chain liquidity. This is why we mentioned that all of these caps could be more conservative, and look forward to sharing more info there next week.

Our initial batch of recommendations for uncapped assets was conservative, with the primary objective of getting reasonable supply caps deployed in production. This document outlines the Chaos v0 methodology for determining supply caps. The methodology adheres to the guideline suggested by @eboado that when listing a new asset, \u201cthe caps are a perfect generalized constraint to cover almost any wide problem for the pool.\u201d\nAlthough the assets discussed have been active historically, we believe that recent market events and the short history of supply caps mandate approaching this as the initial supply cap recommendation methodology. The goal is to start with prudent recommendations and incrementally increasing caps as DEX liquidity increases and market volatility stabilizes.\nMotivation\n\nThis is an initial iteration on supply caps, and we welcome community input and feedback.\n\nAre there additional risk vectors, metrics, or data that the community would like to consider?\n\n\nAs this document and methodology are solidified, it can serve as a guide to list new assets or increase caps for currently listed assets. Transparently sharing the methodology should allow interested parties to source the data and bring it forward as they make various ARCs more pertinent to them.\n\n\n Note: This is the first iteration of the Supply Cap Methodology and aims to promptly provide a solution for the current state of assets across multiple deployments, given the current market instability. Chaos will be iterating over this methodology over the coming weeks, and it is subject to change.\n\nThe General Approach\nTo set the Supply Cap for an asset, we try to answer the question: what is the maximum token value that can be liquidated profitably under extreme scenarios, i.e., when significantly large amounts are being liquidated over a short period? We examine whether the current supply of a given token in Aave V3 eligible for liquidation can be liquidated profitably. We can conclude that if this holds, incurring bad debt is unlikely when assuming healthy and rational liquidator activity. We aim to create a heuristic-based, closed-form formula for answering this question based on current market liquidity while also considering volatility and historical liquidation throughput. Additionally, we want to assess the overall qualitative risk of each asset. Empirically, the Aave Asset Risk Score correlates well with DEX liquidity.\n\nAAVE Risk Qualification Criterion\nAssumptions for Extreme Scenarios\nTo estimate the supply cap for a given asset, we assume a token crash that will drive extreme liquidations. We make several assumptions:\n\nAll supply serves as collateral.\n\nThis is a very defensive assumption that accounts for a worst-case scenario, and we believe it could be relaxed for future iterations\n\n\nFuture crashes are likely to resemble previous crashes in terms of price trajectory\nFuture crashes are likely to resemble previous crashes in terms of liquidity; that is, liquidity provisioning in DEXes will resemble the liquidity in DEXes across previous crashes\nThe distribution of the health factor of accounts that supply this asset will remain similar as the supply grows\n\nSupply Cap Methodology\n1. Reference Price Crashes\n\nFirst, we select $n$ historic price crash trajectories {X1\u2026Xn}\nWe denote the token that crashed as R(Xi)\nThe crashed tokens may differ from the tokens for which we wish to determine supply caps. Using the crash pattern as a common baseline, we adjust liquidity according to the specific token; consider these as the Reference Tokens.\n\n\n2. Observe DEX Liquidity During Crashes\n\nWe then observe token DEX liquidity changes in pools throughout the price crash. Specifically, we\u2019re interested in evaluating the amount that can be sold within a given range of slippage at each point in time. We denote that amount at block t as Amt(t, Slippage), counting the first block of the crash as t=0. Essentially, Amt(t, liquidationPenalty) is the maximum amount of the token that can be sold to the pool by a liquidator at block t, with a constraint that ensures that realized slippage is smaller than the liquidation bonus for the examined asset.\n\n\nIllustration of the process of recording DEX liquidity levels throughout the price crash (Please note,  the numbers used are merely for demonstration purposes)\n3. Extrapolate the Maximum amount to be liquidated from DEX Liquidity\nAfter obtaining the price trajectories of crashes and the corresponding DEX liquidity, we perform a sequence of operations individually for each token to determine its supply cap. We refer to it as the examined token.\nThe sequence of operations we perform for each examined token Token over a price crash scenario of reference token R(Xi) is as follows:\n\n\nDenote the current supply of the token as Sup(Token)\n\n\nDenote the AAVE Liquidation Penalty of each token as Pen(Token)\n\n\n*We derive the liquidity through a correlation between the liquidity amount in DEXes of the reference token, R(X_i), and the examined token at the beginning of the simulation (before the crash) for each slippage %. This is the LiquidityCorrelationFactor. Then we apply this ratio to the liquidity of the reference token at block t.\n\n\nFor each price crash scenario, extrapolate the available liquidity of the examined token across DEXes with slippage equal to Pen(Xi) at block t and denote it as\nAmt(Token, t, Pen(Token)) = Amt(R(Xi),t, Pen(Token) * LiquidityCorrelationFactor(R(Xi), Token, Pen(Token))\nThis is the maximum amount that can be liquidated in this block profitably for a liquidator.\n\n\nRun n simulations of the price trajectories of the examined token with each reference token and for each liquidation record for each block t where liquidation is triggered, the ratio between liquidation amount and available liquidity\nr(Token, t)=LiquidatedAmount(t)/ Amt(t, Pen(Token))\n\n\n4. Determine the new supply cap\nDenote r_m = Max(r(Token(Xi),t))\nFinally, set the new supply cap for each token to be equal to Current Supply(Token) / r_m\nThis is because r_m is the maximum ratio between the liquidated amount with the current supply. By dividing the current supply by the maximum ratio that may be liquidated per block, we achieve the maximum amount that could be liquidated in total and set it as the supply cap for this token.\nPrice Trajectories of other assets\nWhen we simulate the impact of an extreme price movement scenario on an asset, we must take into consideration the impact it may have on other assets. Usually, when the price of a significant asset plummets, we see the impact on the prices of other assets. The LUNA crash is a good example of this. When examining liquidations, there is significance to the prices of other assets - either those borrowed by suppliers of the examined asset or those that serve as collateral together with the examined asset. We are currently using two behaviors of other assets\u2019 price trajectories:\n\nThe first is for significant assets with a market cap larger than $1B. In this case, we assume other assets\u2019 prices will move similarly to how they moved in the referenced price crash.\nThe second is for market leaders, namely ETH and BTC, where a significant crash of either is likely to cause an overall crash of asset prices. When simulating these scenarios, we project other assets\u2019 prices according to their correlation with ETH/BTC.\n\nNote: We are currently utilizing this methodology for medium-large cap assets. Analysis for low-cap assets will be added in upcoming iterations.\nNext Steps\nV0 of the Chaos Supply Cap Methodology is conservative by design. When examining future increases in supply caps, there are two primary relaxations we can explore:\n\nThe assumption that all supply is used as collateral\nWhen using r_m, setting the cap as suggested above will likely ensure all liquidatable collateral can be liquidated under the extreme scenario examined. Taking a less conservative approach, we may select r < r_m, considering the risk of bad debt in a worst-case scenario, e.g., if we can tolerate a bad debt of $100K USD, we can reduce r as long as the calculated bad debt is under that limit.\nThe crashed tokens may differ from the tokens we wish to determine supply caps for. Using the crash pattern as a common baseline, we adjust liquidity according to the specific token; consider these as the Reference Tokens.\n\nIn future proposals, we will provide the community with recommendations based on the above methodology and risk analysis. In addition, we aim to provide data on alternatives with different risk-reward balances for the community to vote on, given an ever changing risk appetite.\nReal-life Examples\nBelow are initial recommendations which we have calculated using this methodology for assets in the Polygon Market. These recommendations were all made with the assumption of zero bad debt tolerance. As mentioned in the \u2018next steps\u2019 section above, this assumptions can be relaxed in future proposals given a community preference for different risk-reward balance.\n1.

Bad debt stems from borrow positions that have not been liquidated. Too much bad debt is a red flag as it indicates poor risk management standards. Most lending protocols do not easily display this data point which leaves users in the dark.\nTotal bad debt in Aave v3 is a relatively small amount of $16.1k (as of 10 Nov \u201822). The dashboard provides a chain-by-chain breakdown to highlight where bad debt accrues.\nHistorically, Aave bad debt has been small and mostly due to dust accounts: The gas cost in liquidating these positions is higher than the payoff.

Whilst also relevant to other lending protocols the sheer size of Aave\u2019s borrow markets represent an attractive target as even small percentage gains could mean substantial USD profits for the attacker.\nTL;DR:\n\nThe attack scenario looks like the following: An attacker can artificially inflate the AVAX price, deposit the token into Aave and borrow against this inflated collateral value. A similar attack played out for the Venus Protocol in May 2021 which bankrupted the protocol.\nLiquidity and LTV are the key profitability drivers: Lower exchange liquidity allows the attacker to manipulate the price much easier (i.e. less cost required), whilst a higher LTV on Aave allows more borrow power (i.e. higher cash proceeds).\nWe show how different liquidity curves may make price manipulation profitable. We look at super-linear, linear and sublinear slippage functions.\nWe conclude that in this simplistic framework the attack is not profitable, however further research is needed, and risk managers of lending protocols need to closely monitor slippage levels of collateral tokens and associated LTVs to pre-empt malicious attacks.\n\n\nAVAX-USD exploit on GMX - What happened\nOn 18 September, a trader engaged in a series of trades to impact the price of AVAX by >2%. This does not seem substantial at first sight but cost Liquidity Providers on perpetual swap exchange GMX.io dearly, losing approx $0.5m. GMX offers zero-slippage trading, based on oracle prices fetched from CEXes.\nThe trader successfully extracted profits from GMX\u2019s AVAX-USD market by opening large positions at 0 slippage, then moving AVAX-USD on CEXes in their favor. The trader switched from long to short 5 times over an hour, creating a sinusoidal pattern.\nNotional trade sizes ranged between $4.2m to $4.8m.\n\n  \n\n      twitter.com\n  \n\n  \n    \nJoshua Lim\n@joshua_j_lim\n\n\n  3/ let's take a look at the first cycle which took place from 01:15:31 to 01:28:11 UTC.

Whales bought a significant amount of $VXS token and deposited them as collateral on Venus Protocol at the peak, bankrupting the protocol in the process (as can be tracked on the Bad Debt Dashboard the Risk DAO has published).\nWhat are the costs involved?\nFirst up, let\u2019s look at the required bankroll: The trader needs to acquire AVAX as collateral asset and move the price in the process.\nBy looking at the GMX incident, some estimates suggest a $700k price tag, based on slippage and the aggregate trading volume. It is not clear what the attacker\u2019s bankroll was but aggregate trading volume amounted to $70m over the period of the attack. However, this was a series of trades where the attacker went long and short and thus could recycle the bankroll.\nAs referenced earlier, a series of trades in the mid-$4m range (notional size) were entered which moved the price by approx 2%. Looking at the AVAX-USDT pair on Binance, it would cost approx $1.3m for a 2% move on a normal weekday.\nModeling methodologies for the price curves\nLet\u2019s imagine Trader Alice who wants to manipulate the AVAX price by 100%. Her preferred trading venue is Binance and she assumes that every $1.3m trade moves the price by 2%.\nWe define the following variables:\nslippate_rate: Assumes 2% for every trade of $1.3m\nqty_trade: This is the n-th trade.\nprice_current: AVAX-USD price of $17.5 (as of 28 September 2022)\nprice_target = price_current*2\nThe following slippage functions are modeled:\nSuper-linear case:\nPrice_new = price_current * (1+slippage_rate)^qty_trade\nAssumes that slippage would increase the higher the percentage change is compared to price_current. This could be explained by positive reflexivity and more traders going long whilst supply of the token remains static.\nLinear case:\nprice_new = price_current * (1+slippage_rate*qty_trade)\nAssumes slippage stays constant regardless of the price changes.\nSublinear case:\nprice_new = price_current * (1+slippage_rate*qty_trade^0.9)\nAssumes the slippage rate decays as token price goes up. A rising token price would attract traders who sell their tokens into the price rally thereby suppressing the slope of the price curve.\nThe cumulative growth rates for the three slippage functions is visualized in the table below (for the first 10 trades).\n\n\nModelling results\nSuper-linear function\nAssuming an super-linear increase of the price based on 2% slippage, Alice would spend $45.5m to acquire 1.9m $AVAX at an average price of $24.5.\n\nIn terms of profitability, this trade would generate a loss of $3.3m. \u201cValue\u201d is defined as the post-pump price of $35 multliplied by the number of $AVAX token acquired.\n\nLinear function\nIf the 2% slippage persists in a linear style, Alice would spend $65m to acquire 2.6m $AVAX at an average cost of $25.4.\n\nIn terms of profitability, this trade would generate a loss of $6.8m.\n\nSub-linear function\nAssuming a sublinear function so that the slippage rate decays by a factor of 0.9, Alice would spend $100.1m to acquire 3.9m $AVAX at an average price of $25.8.\n\nIn terms of profitability, this trade would generate a loss of $12.1m.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nGiven the current risk parameters, the probability of a replay of the GMX attack on Aave is unlikely: The trade is just not profitable enough and an attacker would need to deploy significant sums in this high-risk strategy.\n\nThe scenario with a steeper slippage function (ie super-linear scenario) is more advantageous for malicious actors, as evidenced in the below summary chart: It costs the attacker less to pump the price. Albeit in our model it would still not result in a profit.\n\nIn the case of higher LTVs, however, this strategy could turn profitable giving malicious actors an incentive to attack.\n\nThus, risk managers need to watch the token order books for slippage and LTV parameters to stay on top of a potential gamification of collateral prices.", "reads": 52, "readers_count": 51, "score": 640.4, "word_count": 1604, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/micro-level-user-level-risk-monitoring-idea", "topic_id": 10208, "title": "Micro-Level (User Level) Risk Monitoring Idea", "posts_count": 1, "views": 1428, "like_count": 0, "author_username": "ccb_roci", "created": "2022-10-08T08:04:09.380Z", "text": "Introduction\nRociFi is a protocol building the two key pillars of Web3\u2019s future \u2013 on-chain credit scores and under-collateralized lending. The credit scoring is powered by our non-fungible credit score (NFCS), which ranks users according to their likelihood of repaying an under-collateralized loan. The scale is 1 to 10 with 1 being the best score and 10 being the worst.\nFor reference, NFCS is built using RociFi protocol repayment data and other DeFi protocols; including Aave and Compound. The depth and breadth of data allows the NFCS to be the clear leader in on-chain credit scores which has applicabilities to other lending protocols.\nIn particular, lending protocols like Aave could use RociFi NFCS to achieve better capital efficiency by offering higher LTVs to higher scored borrowers \u2013 generating greater revenues without a demonstrable increase in insolvency risk \u2013 akin to a micro-level Gauntlet.\nThe best part is that the NFCS API is open to any developer or protocol to call for real-time scores of any NFCS holder, thus they could integrate this score based on each protocol\u2019s individual needs.\nRevenue Increase\nBelow we provide comparisons of the revenue Aave and Compound generated historically and what they would have generated using RociFi NFCS scores for higher capital efficiency.

By being able to offer higher LTVs, Aave would generated an additional $123,817,568 in value (net of liquidations) with a negligible increase in insolvency risk.\n\nScreen Shot 2022-10-08 at 10.02.47 AM1224\u00d7618 55.3 KB\n\nTokens Considered : [\u2018DAI\u2019, \u2018USDC\u2019, \u2018USDT\u2019, \u2018EURS\u2019, \u2018agEUR\u2019, \u2018jEUR\u2019, \u2018AAVE\u2019, \u2018LINK\u2019, \u2018WBTC\u2019, \u2018WETH\u2019, \u2018WMATIC\u2019, \u2018CRV\u2019, \u2018SUSHI\u2019, \u2018GHST\u2019, \u2018DPI\u2019, \u2018BAL\u2019], these were simulated with the following LTV\u2019s : [0.97, 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, 0.6, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.65, 0.75, 0.2, 0.25, 0.2, 0.2]. Note that Revenue simulations assume no default\nBy scoring borrowers with the NFCS, Aave is able to achieve better capital efficiency by not penalizing responsible borrowers, enabling higher loan allocation to this subgroup, i.e. give good borrowers more loans and less to worse borrowers. This simple heuristic is illustrated in the distribution of loan amount by score chart below.\n\nUsing RociFi NFCS, despite higher LTVs, a heavy concentration of Aave loan volume went to the very best borrowers, i.e. credit scores 1-5, comprising 92% of total loan volume issued. Thus, increased revenue with minimal increase in insolvency risk.\nConclusion\nIntegrating onchain credit scores from RociFi NFCS allows existing lending protocols to offer more competitive LTVs, thus higher risk-adjusted revenues. Additional positive byproducts of adopting RociFi NFCS by protocols are (1) incremental revenue can be passed back to the community and (2) better product attractiveness via higher LTV for borrowers with lower rates, and higher supply rates to lenders.", "reads": 20, "readers_count": 19, "score": 1929.0, "word_count": 584, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/understanding-risk-on-aave", "topic_id": 8247, "title": "Understanding Risk on Aave", "posts_count": 4, "views": 1753, "like_count": 5, "author_username": "cevsde", "created": "2022-05-23T21:01:04.802Z", "text": "Hey!

Our parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Our simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. Our individual collateral pages on the dashboard cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding other interesting inputs and outputs related to our simulations. For more information, please refer to our Aave market risk assessment where we provide a tactical understanding of our model architecture.\n\nSpecification\nThese past two weeks saw slight decreases in volatility and increases in liquidity and trading volume, which our simulations picked up on. In addition, our recent market downturn report showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted.

Most liquidations on the Aave protocol happened between 4:30 and 5:45 UTC when the price of ETH dropped nearly 13%. Below is a graph of liquidation by collateral and repay asset.\n\nAlthough volatility for assets is slightly higher, the abundance of liquidity and active market participants is a positive sign for the health of Aave! For example, the total value of CRV (curve dao token) liquidated was large compared to the total collateral used on Aave. Lower LTV, lower liquidation threshold, and higher liquidation bonus protect the protocol from insolvencies. However, multiple liquidations of over 400,000 USD occurred in quick succession. This shows ample liquidity for liquidators even in times of high network congestion. These market events provide important data points for measuring tail risk.\nFor reference, previous analysis of liquidations on Aave from May 2021 can be found here: Aave Protocol Liquidation Retrospective: May 2021 | by Watson Fu | Gauntlet | Medium\nAlthough some assets currently have higher volatility, our analysis shows that it is safe to increase borrowing parameters and decrease liquidation bonus values.

As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) and 74M of KNC are still in the old KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract. There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.\nConsidering that exchanges (e.g. Kraken, Crypto.com) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.\n\nRisk Dashboard\nThe community should use Gauntlet\u2019s Risk Dashboard to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nInitiate a Snapshot immediately since the community has already weighed in on changes of this nature recently.\nTargeting an AIP on 2021-12-20\n", "reads": 42, "readers_count": 41, "score": 1063.4, "word_count": 1006, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/aave-risk-dashboard-by-gauntlet-launched", "topic_id": 5700, "title": "Aave Risk Dashboard by Gauntlet Launched", "posts_count": 1, "views": 2545, "like_count": 14, "author_username": "shaan", "created": "2021-09-22T20:46:38.319Z", "text": "Hi Folks!\nOver the last couple of months, the Gauntlet team has been building the Aave Risk Dashboard. We are happy to announce that the Aave Risk Dashboard is now live at gov.gauntlet.network/aave!! We are very excited to release this dashboard to the community and start to gather feedback so we can continue to iterate on it and maximize its impact.\nA few high level points/reminders:\n\nThere are two goals for the initial dashboard launch: a) help the community understand our methodology and recommendations and b) help the community understand how Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations help reduce risk and increase capital efficiency for the protocol.\n\nValue at Risk (VaR) and Borrow Usage (BU) are topline measures of Risk and Capital Efficiency respectively. VaR conveys capital at risk due to insolvencies and liquidations when markets are under duress (i.e. Black Thursday). We currently compute VaR (based on a measure of protocol insolvency) at the 95th percentile of our simulation runs assuming higher than normal volatility. Borrow Usage is defined in detail in this post.\nYou may notice VaR being $0 for quite a few assets. This is due to the fact that these assets do not represent a significant portion of Aave\u2019s borrow positions and that liquidator agents prefer large positions due to higher guarantees on making a profit. This leads to no liquidations or insolvencies happening in our sims for the smaller assets and positions in Aave.\nWe have removed the historical VaR and Borrow Usage charts from the initial version of the dashboard, as we need a bit more time to backfill market data and test. We expect to launch the charts in a few weeks.\nTo get an even more in depth understanding of our methodology for running Simulations take a look at our Aave report. In particular, Section 4.3 and Appendix Section C. While we have updated the actual data underlying the sims, the methodology remains relevant.\n\nWith the Dashboard, we are excited about making the Aave protocol safer and more capital efficient. With the most recent round of parameter changes being proposed in AIP-38, we are able to reduce Value at Risk by $7.68M, while maintaining the same level of Borrow Usage! By reducing Liquidation Bonuses we are able to reduce the chance of cascading liquidations and thus reduce potential borrower losses, making the Aave protocol safer overall. Going forward we plan on keeping the dashboard up-to-date with the current state of the Aave protocol and our recommended parameter changes.\nThis is just the start of our Risk Dashboard product for Aave and we plan on refining it with the community.

But the protocol should also protect the users and of course avoid slashing anyone if the system stability isn\u2019t compromised.\nSo I would like to talk about $MATIC and $AAVE having both 50% borrow capacity and 65% Liquidation threshold.\nI completely understand the 50% because of volatility of these assets and being overexposed to those as collateral could be harmful. However I like 65% is pretty few.\nHaving like $AAVE $MATIC and $ETH in equivalent proportion brings the overall liquidation threshold to 0.71 and the borrow capacity to 0.6.\nEven being cautious and borrowing to 0.4 of borrowing capacity, if the price of the assets goes down half, that would bring the account to 0.8 and triggering the threshold.\nAnd this is considering having $ETH with 82.5% of liquidation threshold which brings stability here. Having just these two honorables assets would trigger the liquidation with a 39% drop of the price of these assets.\nBut such events do not happen in a second on these assets, and many bots have had enough time to take care of the liquidations and arbitrages of even more uncautious users, renforcing the stability and safety of the Aave protocol along the way.\nSo while I understand the limited borrowing capacity for such assets, I don\u2019t really get why 70 or 75% liquidation threshold shouldn\u2019t be considered. That could bring more opportunity to be confident in using Aave liquidities to explore interesting opportunities Polygon ecosystem offers.\nAt 70% of LT for $AAVE and $MATIC that would bring the overal LT to 75% protecting against 46.7% drop, which is way better to protect just getting caught by the dip.\nAt 75% of LT it is 77% overall LT, and protects against 49% drop, which is very good.\nManaging these kind of positions could be at risk for an unaware user, while the security of the protocol doesn\u2019t seem so compromised in the case of a small increase of some LT, like $WBTC $AAVE or $MATIC. And that would give users more time to realize positions could be at risks, while adding no structural risk to end up over-collateralized on these assets because of the low Borrowing Capacity.\nThe rates can be checked at Polygon Market - Risk.\nPlease let me know your thoughts", "reads": 18, "readers_count": 17, "score": 263.6, "word_count": 423, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/just-got-hacked-unsure-if-its-the-cookies-on-aave-or-metamask-issue", "topic_id": 4945, "title": "Just got hacked, unsure if it's the cookies on AAVE or Metamask issue", "posts_count": 1, "views": 1767, "like_count": 0, "author_username": "zupcuz", "created": "2021-07-24T20:17:40.070Z", "text": "Hi guys, this is my first post,\nI just found out a series of foreign transactions on my ether scan,\nboth on Matic net and Etherium Mainnet\nLast night about 6 hours ago, I approved Uniswap on several token permissions and AAVE cookies.

The report expounds on methodology minutiae and specific results of our research. This post should serve as a TLDR and also give members of the community an opportunity to give feedback and suggestions about other market risk implications to the Aave protocol.\nBackground\nAt the time of writing, Aave has over $7, $8, $10 billion in TVL (thanks @Anjan-ParaFi!). With growth of this scale, mitigating financial and market risks is increasingly important as billions in customer funds are on the line.\nWithin decentralized finance (DeFi), borrowing protocols have four main risk factors:\n\nSecurity risk\nGovernance risk\nOracle risk\nMarket risk\n\nThis post will focus on market risk, but we discuss how the Aave protocol addresses each of the other risk factors in our formal report.\nDefining Market Risks\nThere are four primary sources of market risk within the protocol:\n\nExtreme downward price movement: Shocks to market prices of collateral that cause the contract to become insolvent due to under-collateralization\nAsset illiquidity and liquidator inaction: Loss of liquidity in an external market place, leading to a liquidator being disincentivized to liquidate defaulted collateral\nCascading liquidations: liquidations lower external market prices which in turn lead to further liquidations (i.e. a deflationary spiral)\nSlashing of the safety module: Insolvency of the safety module due to extreme events where multiple collateral types concurrently fail to be liquidated\n\nHow do we test if the Aave protocol can be resilient to each of these market risks? Simulated stress tests!\nSimulated Stress Tests\nThe main tool that we use to perform simulation-based stress tests on Aave\u2019s Ethereum smart contracts is agent-based simulation (ABS). ABS has been used in a variety of stress test contexts, including to estimating censorship in cryptocurrency protocols, detecting fraudulent trading activity in CFTC exchanges,and stress testing frameworks from the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. These simulations, while powerful, can be difficult to make both useful and accurate as model complexity can make it hard to match experimental results. Careful design, tuning, and infrastructure architecture can help avoid these pitfalls and has made ABS invaluable in industries such as algorithmic trading and self-driving car deployment.\nPlease take a look at our report to learn more about our simulation environment!\nMany elements of our simulation are designed to study the aforementioned market risks.\nExtreme downward price movement\nWe use a multi-asset correlated Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) to simulate price trajectories. The two most important aspects of this model are asset volatility and asset correlation. In order to properly simulate market capitulation and extreme price drops, we train models on historical data with various volatility regimes. Below is the price of ETH on Black Thursday with the cumulative liquidation value on the Aave V1 protocol. Both the price path and the delay in liquidations are key inputs to our simulation.\n\n1496\u00d71000\n\nWith the abundance of cryptoassets available on the Aave protocol, it is important to quantify and understand asset correlation, which can give insight into possible contagion and correlated liquidation and insolvency risk. These are the correlation matrices for Aave V2 in March 2021 (Top) and Aave V1 in January 2021 (bottom).\n\n1600\u00d71529\n\n\n817\u00d7773\n\nAsset illiquidity and liquidator inaction\nAsset illiquidity can lead to liquidator inaction because the liquidator will need to give up large amounts of profit to trade out of collateral and borrow asset positions. Below is a visualization of optimal liquidator trade sizing with respect to expected slippage in different volatilities and order sizes.\n\n1008\u00d7650\n\nIn addition, extreme network congestion will also lead to liquidator inaction. In order to simulate gas congestion and transaction delay, we construct modified and truncated normal distributions from 3 month trailing gas price data. At each time step in the simulation, we sample from the probability distribution to define the liquidator behavior.\nAs we increase ETH volatility in our simulations, we also increase the mean, standard deviation, and skew of the gas price distribution. Below are the daily gas percentile curves for February 2021 and generated gas curves.\n\n1600\u00d7887\n\n1440\u00d7720\n\nCascading liquidations\nThe deflationary spiral that can occur as a result of large liquidations is reproduced in our simulation by training market impact models. These models are trained on order-book (for centralized exchanges) and AMM (for decentralized exchanges) data. After a trade occurs (i.e. selling of liquidated collateral), we capture the impact that it has in the short-term and long-term.\nTwo factors that can affect the market impact are asset volatility and the size of the trades. We define the scaled liquidity of an asset as the average daily traded volume of the asset divided by the total collateral on the protocol. This is a snapshot of the market characteristics of each of the assets on Aave V2 in March 2021. \n1600\u00d71173\n\nSlashing of the safety module\nThe Aave protocol has a safety module denominated in the native AAVE token which serves as a backstop for protocol insolvency. Yield seeking investors can purchase AAVE, stake (lock) it within an insurance pool, and earn a pro-rata portion of AAVE rewards (currently 550 AAVE per day).\nIf an Aave market reaches a state where its liabilities (outstanding liens) are greater than its assets (collateral), then the AAVE safety module covers the shortfall of all markets voted by the community.\nOur assumptions for safety module slashing are very conservative: we only consider the staked Aave safety module and do not use the liquidity provided by the 80/20 Balancer pool. In addition, we make the assumption that most centralized liquidity will disappear in a slashing event. In simulation, whenever there is an insolvency on the protocol, we sell Aave into the market and model the impact with only DEX liquidity.\nMetrics\nWe will first define metrics that will help us answer these questions in a quantitative manner.\n\nInsolvent account: Any account where the total borrow value in USD is larger than the total collateral value in USD.\nNet insolvent value: When looking at a single account, this is the net insolvent value of the account at the end of a simulation run divided by the total collateral value of the account at the beginning of the run. When looking at the entire protocol, this is the sum of the net insolvent value of all accounts divided by the total collateral value of all accounts.\nNet insolvent value percentage: When looking at the entire protocol, this is the sum of the net insolvent value of all accounts divided by the total collateral value of all accounts.\nAsset net insolvent value percentage: This is the sum of net insolvent value divided by the total collateral value pro-rata supply percentage for all accounts that supply a given asset as collateral. Because of the many-to-many nature of collateral and borrowed assets on the Aave protocol, attributing insolvency statistics to specific assets can be convoluted.\nSlashing run percentage: This is the percentage of simulation runs that end with greater than 1% of the total value (in Aave) of the safety module slashed to cover insolvencies and with greater than 10% drop in total value (in USD) of the safety module.\n\nResults\nOur baseline results for almost 6000 simulation runs showed that the protocol is resilient based on our metrics (<1% net insolvent value percentage of the entire protocol and <5% net insolvent value percentage of every asset). The graphs below show the percentage of users who will have any insolvency and the net insolvent value percentage of each asset in our initial simulation runs.\n\n1008\u00d71008\n\n1008\u00d71008\n\nThe initial simulation runs also serve to identify which assets\u2019 parameters could have the largest impact on the health of the protocol. We chose YFI to study the impacts of various borrow parameters and liquidation parameters. Below is a graph of YFI asset net insolvent value percentage as a function of correlated asset volatility and loan-to-value ratio. Note that the insolvent value percentage is monotonic in both loan-to-value and volatility scalar, as one intuitively expects.\n\n1590\u00d71375\n\nNext is a graph of YFI asset net insolvent value percentage as a function of correlated asset volatility and liquidation threshold. Note that the choice of liquidation threshold is only important at high enough volatilities: at low volatilities, changes to the threshold do little to change net insolvent value.\n\n1594\u00d71379\n\nThis is a graph of YFI asset net insolvent value percentage as a function of correlated asset volatility and liquidation bonus. Note that this measures the likelihood of correlated cascades (e.g. the y-axis is the volatility of an asset highly correlated to YFI with different liquidity levels). This figure illustrates that correlated assets admit a `safe region\u2019 in terms of liquidation bonus where net insolvent value stays relatively low. Unlike the previous figure, we see that there is a much stronger dependence on liquidation threshold even at lower volatility scalars.\n\n1555\u00d71379\n\nThis is the total collateralization of the Aave protocol as a function of correlated asset volatility and liquidation bonus. Note that the total collateralization ratio of the system is inversely related to the net insolvency value at high volatility levels when the liquidation bonus is above 115%.\n\n1600\u00d71304\n\nFinally, this is the percentage of simulation runs that ended with significant slashing (>1% Safety Module sold and >10% decrease in USD value). Note that we only observe significant slashing at high liquidation bonus and volatilities and that there is a `safe region\u2019 of moderately sized liquidation bonuses.\n\n1599\u00d71386\n\nIn section 6.3.1 of the formal report, we give a more mathematical explanation for why the liquidation bonus has this relationship with protocol safety.\nConclusions\nIn this report we conducted a market-risk assessment of the Aave protocol via agent-based simulations run against the Aave contracts.\nWe stress-tested the liquidation mechanism under a wide range of market volatility and sizing scenarios to ensure that the protocol can prevent borrowers from becoming under-collateralized in most of these cases.\nWe also used historical market data from centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure that assumptions about volatility and slippage are representative of real-world conditions.\nWe found that the protocol can withstand aggressive borrowing parameters even in extreme asset volatility and network congestion situations. However, variations in the liquidation bonuses of the protocol lead to more drastic and unexpected results, and liquidation bonus should not be the primary tool used to adjust protocol-wide market risk.\nWe also studied the relationship between borrower behavior as a result of borrowing parameter adjustments to understand the returns of both AAVE holders and lenders on the Aave protocol as a result of parameter changes. As market conditions change,\nthe optimal parameters and suggestions will need to dynamically shift as well.\nOur results suggest that monitoring and adjustment of protocol parameters is crucial for reducing risk to lenders and slashing in the safety module.\nThe community can expect us to be more active going forward with parameter suggestions and liquidation analysis in the near future!", "reads": 78, "readers_count": 77, "score": 3245.4, "word_count": 2851, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/shared-market-exposure", "topic_id": 2322, "title": "Shared market exposure", "posts_count": 4, "views": 1788, "like_count": 4, "author_username": "A5burger", "created": "2021-02-04T16:52:17.187Z", "text": "Disclosure; not technical, just a logic minded retard.\nFirst Id like to thank the team on behalf of the community for all the hard work over the years, and congratulate everyone on the success, below are some points I felt needed to be brought to attention, perhaps some are wrong but I did my best to read as much as I could before summarizing my thoughts as best I understand them. This is not a proposal, Im just hoping to open a discussion.\nFinancial risks; I understand the thought process to diversify risks into seperate daos with seperate backstops however if theirs s shared market between them (usdt, Dai, etc) then we are at risk of any of these crashing and blowing through all layers of backstop. I liken this to the insurance industry, local providers (home auto etc) purchase insurance from a national provider, they diversify their risk across a nation (assuming natural disaster only hits one location) National Insurance providers buy Global insurance to further diversify (risk is spread further incase natural disaster effects entire country) great system until their is an international pandemic.

Essentially burying new markets from eyes of the market. Shouldnt we be highlighting this?\nOne market to rule them all\nCan we tranche this model on a smaller scale? Can new coins be individually backstopped by whomever proposes the market until a milestone health metric is reached where the backstop gets returned to original investor and the market gets added to the main pool. We can attach some metric for utility strength (dom, mc, investor sentiment) I dont see the diversity in pooling a handful of high risk coins into one market. If anything this increases risk, the same with diluting high risk markets with stablecoins etc. who knows how long tether will be stable.\nNew coins backstopping themselves would operate similar to an ico in which the MM will fund or crowdsource the backstop the the new market they wish to create. Doing this they can even present a 0% borrow apy to give users a chance to try a new coin without investing too much. this would still benefit aave as they would still need to deposit collatteral in the main market to take the loan from the new market. I dont think there even needs to be incentive in the mm for this as their incentive is in the growth of the market of the currency they wish to promote. As our metric rises based on TBD factors the backstop % can slowly decrease over a period of time.

We have worked with the Aave team in parameter optimization for V2, which includes loan-to-value ratio (LTV), liquidation threshold, and liquidation incentive values for various assets. The main purpose of this post is to provide some color into the work we have been doing with the Aave team, as well as motivate the framework for high-level analysis that we will continue to perform. We purposely exclude the rigorous definitions and methodology for our simulations in this post, but that will be available in a formal report to be released shortly. With that said, we hope to illuminate and spark discussion about overall market and systemic risk within the Aave protocol.\nAgent-Based Simulation\nThe main tool used for assessing market and system risk in Aave is agent-based simulation. Such simulations can accurately assess how well liquidations are handled under stressful scenarios, such as Black Thursday. Our simulation platform allows data scientists to directly stress test agent models (models of user behavior) against the real EVM bytecode that is used on mainnet. By stress testing against actual contract code, we reduce the surface area for false negative safety results.\nTo construct models of borrower, supplier, and liquidator behavior, we first analyze on-chain and market data. Using these models, we run Monte Carlo simulations of different users competing and interacting with the protocol to assess safety. Our methodology for stress testing DeFi protocols was established in our analyses of Compound and THORChain. For our analysis of Aave, we significantly improved the models used for analyzing borrower behavior in Compound. These model improvements allow us to handle cross-margining and better reflect multi-collateral borrowing behavior. This allows us to stress test the protocol\u2019s safety under liquidity duress and more accurately handle the wide variety of assets utilized within Aave.\nKey Simulation Inputs\nOur simulations focus on stress-testing the protocol under extreme market conditions, including high volatility, low liquidity, and high gas congestion. The main levers available to the protocol to mitigate risk during these conditions are loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, liquidation threshold, and liquidation incentive. We also utilize these variables to help define and guide agent logic within the system. Our simulations allow for the isolation of specific changes to each of these values per asset.\nLTV\nThis variable helps to define our borrower and lender logic. As we change LTV per asset, it changes the amount that can be borrowed against a particular collateral. For each asset, we also define how borrower behavior will change based on LTV changes.\nLiquidation Threshold\nThe difference between the LTV and liquidation threshold of a particular asset is the minimum buffer for an adverse price movement that a loan can withstand. Changing liquidation threshold alters the amount of time that borrowers have to resupply collateral to maintain healthy loans.\nLiquidation Incentive\nThis variable helps to define our liquidator agent logic. The main consideration for liquidators is balancing the slippage, trading fees, and transaction fees against the liquidation incentive. This provides the framework for defining optimal liquidator behavior.\nAsset Volatility and Correlation\nHistorical data about price movements defines the price trajectories used in our simulations, but it also impacts how our liquidators behave. Changing liquidator behavior in times of high volatility and low liquidity can give insight to systemic risk. Another key aspect of our simulations is understanding asset correlation and its effects on protocol health. This is the correlation matrix of the assets on the Aave protocol over the from December 2020 to January 2021:\n\nimage817\u00d7773 78 KB\n\nIn our simulations, we are using correlated multi-asset geometric Brownian motion models for each of the asset price trajectories.\nNetwork Congestion\nAnother key aspect of understanding how Aave will perform under high stress situations is network congestion. We add gas price and transaction delay implications by building gas distribution curves on three month trailing data, and use random samples in our liquidator logic. In addition, we fit expected transaction delay times to liquidation calls.\nUser Behavior\nThere are idiosyncratic risks for each asset that might be missed through general market statistics including volatility and liquidity. In addition to considering these general risks, we monitor borrow and lend behavior on a per asset level. Specifically, one metric is borrow usage rate per asset which can be defined as:\n\nwhere U is the utilization ratio of each user:\n\nThis particular metric provides information about how aggressively suppliers of a specific asset borrow against their supply. At the time of this post, the total size of the V2 protocol is still less than 20% of V1, so we are currently utilizing V1 user behavior for our simulations, but this should change over time:\n\n870\u00d7485\n\nKey Simulation Outputs\nThe following metrics are a few ways that we monitor overall protocol health and safety throughout our simulations. These metrics guide how we make suggestions for the previously stated key protocol variables.\nInsolvency\nThe main output used to determine overall protocol market risk is account insolvencies. Whenever an account holds more debt, or borrowed assets, than collateral, or supplied assets, the account can be considered to be insolvent. On the protocol level, we monitor the gross and net insolvent value of all assets. Because many users of Aave hold multi-asset debt as well as multi-asset collateral, we also look at the gross and net insolvent value per asset by using pro rata attributions of the insolvent debt.\nLiquidation Values\nOne main mechanic that the Aave protocol utilizes to maintain the overall health of the protocol is liquidations. The total liquidated value and total liquidatable debt are valuable metrics. However, another important output is \u201cadverse liquidations\u201d. As explained in the OpenZeppelin audit of Aave [H08] Counterproductive incentives, there exist regimes where liquidations do not improve the overall health of a specific loan, but rather push it towards insolvency. During simulation runs, we track the changes to the volume and frequency of adverse liquidations, as well as the clustering of liquidations in terms of size. Increases in adverse liquidations places more onus on users to resupply collateral. Although insolvency statistics may not increase throughout some simulations, these metrics shed light into some hidden systemic risks.\nResults\nAs previously mentioned, we have been working with the Aave team on working with parameter suggestions that can balance protocol safety and capital efficiency. In particular, two of the major suggestions that we made were decreasing risk limits on YFI and increasing risk limits on WBTC. In this particular set of simulation results, we do a sweep of LTV and liquidation threshold changes for YFI against various volatilities. For each of the parameter and volatility settings, we run 15 simulations with differing realized price trajectories and gas prices. In these simulations, we also shifted borrower behavior based on LTV and liquidation threshold changes. Below are plots of the total collateralization of the protocol, the net insolvent value of the protocol, and the net insolvent value of just YFI for the varying initial conditions for on-chain borrower data and market data from November 2020:\n\nimage828\u00d7702 25.9 KB\n\n\nimage818\u00d7703 22.7 KB\n\n\nimage825\u00d7710 24.7 KB\n\nThe volatility scalar is a multiplier applied to each of the asset volatilities used to generate correlated price trajectories. The risky asset borrow scalar is a multiplier that directly changes the reserve configurations for a particular asset (in this case YFI), as well as directly changing borrower behavior. The overall health of the protocol is maintained even when we increase the annualized volatility an order of magnitude larger than the trailing one month data at the time, which can be seen in the net insolvency value of around 1%. However, when analyzing just accounts holding YFI, there was substantial insolvency risk at extremely high volatility settings. This guided suggestions in lowering the liquidation threshold for YFI in Aave V2. In addition, note the transitions of the total collateralization of the entire protocol at the end of each set of simulation. As the borrow scalar increases, it follows that total collateralization should decrease at the beginning of each simulation. As volatility increases, there is a non-linear relationship with total collateralization. This is a result of the dependence of our liquidator logic on choice of collateral and liquidation value on market conditions. More specifically, there were particular LINK positions that were liquidatable more quickly in high volatility settings. When those liquidations happen more quickly, the removal of these risky positions leads to a higher collateralization value at the end of certain simulations, but as volatility continues to increase, the calculated slippage and market impact in our liquidator logic results in decisions to not liquidate these positions.\nA similar set of simulations were run across WBTC LTV and liquidation threshold values. Total collateralization and net insolvency values were similar, but the WBTC net insolvency values were lower and more importantly, the impact of increasing LTV and liquidation threshold on insolvency was low:\n\nimage816\u00d7704 22.9 KB\n\nUpdate\nParameter optimization is an on-going process. An important consideration for our liquidator logic is asset volatility and liquidity, and our simulations are run using the most recent market data. Given the increase in trading volume of YFI and lower market impact of large trades, the insolvency metric for YFI has decreased substantially in January 2021:\n\nimage831\u00d7708 23.1 KB\n\nNext Steps\nThe report analyzing the protocol will be published in the near future and will formalize our findings in the context of protocol market risks and safety. As more data is available for V2, we will continue to fine-tune our simulations to changes in user behavior in the new protocol. In the future, we hope that our simulations can guide parameter changes to the Aave protocol by providing valuable insights into economic risks.

This is problematic as the stable rate only rebalances under stressed conditions, losing some of the risk management benefits of the variable rate.\nThe share of stable rates in V2 has significantly increased for all stablecoins:\n\nDAI from 18.57% to 65.3%\nUSDC from 29.13% to 69.65%\nUSDT 45.73% to 77.2%\n\nThe reason for that is that compared to the market conditions when V2 launched, many new stablecoin farms appeared, which dramatically increased the demand for stablecoins. The current implementation of the Lending rate oracle cannot keep up with the ever changing market conditions.\nThis shows to be unhealthy in the long term: too aggressive stable rates fail to attract new liquidity, which dampens the protocol growth and imposes more UX overhead (more difficulty to withdraw liquidity as there is high utilization).\nThe genesis team proposes two solutions:\n\n\nthe short term fix is to manually override the lending rate oracle (which is still under the control of the Aave genesis team) and impose a base stable rate of 7% (against the current 4%). A base that is almost twice as high will at the same time disincentivize stable borrowing for the short medium/term, or provide higher APY for LPs if the borrowers still choose to borrow at stable.\n\n\nThe long term fix is to get rid of the Lending rate oracle completely by algorithmically set the spread between the stable rate and variable rate. This can be achieved by calculating the ratio\n\n\n\nWhere Ds is the total debt stable and Dv is the total debt variable. When R > 1, it means more of the reserve is being borrowed at stable, which increases the spread between stable and variable for new loans. When R < 1, the spread can be lower, to incentivize stable rate borrowing. The equation for the spread can be adjusted to target whatever value of R.\nThis removes the need for the lending rate oracle altogether, which also reduces the centralization risk and decreases gas costs.", "reads": 66, "readers_count": 65, "score": 1453.2, "word_count": 615, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/help-with-aave-lend-conversion-problem", "topic_id": 2185, "title": "Help with aave (Lend) conversion problem", "posts_count": 1, "views": 1584, "like_count": 0, "author_username": "Logan", "created": "2021-01-23T14:19:05.947Z", "text": "Does anyone know who to contact at aave to see what happened to my conversion of aave (Lend) to aave?\nOn 1/19/21 I sent 50 aave (Lend) to aaves smart contract and they were converted to aave and sent to my Atomic wallet.\nHash\n0xc243f02a1a5b1e29bf7b80a7be6c47a54787fda06ae5e7ac408e495b85eb58f9\nSo I sent the remaining 409.488 to the same address and it has over 24000 confirmations but I still have not received them in my wallet!\nHash\n0x2248bc29b0fd885cb5b8fdcb5708e8376cb540e7f93d3f832c91c291fd53f9b0\nAny help would be appreciated.\nThanks", "reads": 26, "readers_count": 25, "score": 15.2, "word_count": 322, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/cost-to-transact", "topic_id": 2209, "title": "Cost to transact", "posts_count": 4, "views": 1731, "like_count": 5, "author_username": "UndeadBeat", "created": "2021-01-25T16:13:12.736Z", "text": "Hi all,\nI\u2019ve staked some coins and noticed that the cost to have transactions with the smart contract are fairly expensive.\nIs this a product of the ERC20 design and there\u2019s nothing to be done?\nOr is there a potential growth area to reduce to cost to interact?", "reads": 37, "readers_count": 36, "score": 97.4, "word_count": 458, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/request-for-brainstorm-thoughts-on-money-market-powered-governance-attack", "topic_id": 911, "title": "Request for Brainstorm : Thoughts on Money Market powered Governance Attack", "posts_count": 22, "views": 5228, "like_count": 41, "author_username": "Jordan", "created": "2020-10-15T18:28:22.227Z", "text": "Governance attack\nOne of the premises of decentralized governance is that token holders will act in good faith as they are holding assets and thus are exposed to the consequences of the decisions and votes they make.\nThis is for example the rationale behind the Maker Emergency Shutdown module, which requires to burn a consequent amount of MKR in order to shutdown the maker protocol. As of today the amount of MKR in Aave isn\u2019t enough to trigger the emergency shutdown but the last thing we should want for the protocol is that the growing interest from the Maker community in using Aave puts the Maker Protocol and DAI, an essential building block of our ecosystem, at risk.\nBeyond Maker, it\u2019s all the decentralized governance ecosystem which can fall victim to such an attack. The closest exemple to such a governance attack is what happened with the Steem blockchain with centralized exchanges getting involved. Not your tokens, not your protocol.\nThis was an influence based attack, but a whale backed attack in DeFi would look like someone using ETH as collateral to borrow YFI, MKR, UNI or Aave in order to propose and pass a malicious proposal. This is a threat that makes governance aware and risk averse stakeholders reluctant to use protocols such as Aave since, as they use their token as collateral, someone else can borrow those tokens for governance attack.\nVoting with aTokens\naTokens are the representations of your deposits in the Aave protocol.\nTo prepare the ongoing token migration, LEND borrowing was blocked which also enabled the use of aLEND as a voting asset, since double voting was not possible as the underlying LEND could not be borrowed.\nThis was a success and open now the possibility for other protocols to support aTokens votings.\nIf the underlying token can\u2019t be borrowed, then risk averse stakeholders could vote in their respective governance using aTokens if the protocol supports it (As they should!)\naUNI, aMKR, aAave and aYFI could be used for both governance in their respective protocol and leverage in Aave.\nRegarding the Aave governance, it seems clear that it can\u2019t allow voting with aAave if Aave can be borrowed as it opens to a \u201cleverage governance attack\u201d : e.g. a holder of 100 AAVE could deposit it into the protocol, getting 100 AAVE. Somebody else (or himself, but lower amount) could then borrow the 100 AAVE. At this point, from 100 AAVE, 200 \u201cunits of voting power\u201d have been created. Even considering from the governance that the supply to measure voting power from should be 200 (AAVE+aAAVE), in practice, a person doing this kind of leverage by himself will just \u201cboost\u201d his voting power compared with plain AAVE holders not leveraging.\nEnabling aToken support also solves the difficult of calculating the proper combined supply and with it percentage over it: e.g. in a potential scenario where to submit a proposal to the Aave governance is needed a percentage of combined AAVE+aAAVE+stkAAVE supply, the fair calculation of this percentage is more complex than just using the AAVE supply (as non-deposited AAVE supply + aAAVE supply = AAVE supply).\nFor the previous reasons, there are two points of discussion/solutions proposed for this thread, with complete openness for others appearing:\n\n\nNot enabling AAVE and UNI as borrowing assets on the Aave protocol and disabling MKR and YFI, while pushing for those protocols to support aUNI, aYFI and aMKR voting.\n\n\nSetting a global borrowing limit on those assets in the Aave protocol, considering the governance voting thresholds, and taking this limit into account on the calculation of voting power.\n\n\nThis thread is inspired and consequential to the discussion/polling with positive outcome here Aave Protocol Token Addition - Community Sentiment Poll , and Proposal to add AAVE as collateral only.\nWhat are your thoughts on the matter and which road do you think is the best for the growth of the aave protocol and the safety of DeFi governance as a whole ?", "reads": 104, "readers_count": 103, "score": 1195.8, "word_count": 4102, "category_id": 7}, {"url": "https://governance.aave.com//t/cream-finance-help", "topic_id": 776, "title": "Cream.Finance help!", "posts_count": 3, "views": 2245, "like_count": 2, "author_username": "RickiiHard", "created": "2020-10-09T00:59:10.998Z", "text": "Hey guys, long term holder since Ethlend\u2026 I have simply gone to sleep and woken up to Cream finance \u201cpausing\u201d their Lend market on their platform, and im stuck with 8600 lend in there with no liquidity left?
