Both ETH and BTC saw substantial drops, with ETH plummeting by 17% and BTC by 12% from their recent peaks. Particularly noteworthy is the occurrence of 10% and 8.3% drops within just 30 minutes, reflecting the market\u2019s volatility and the speed at which prices can fluctuate. This swift downturn also affected more volatile crypto assets, with many experiencing drops exceeding 20%. As a result, we summarize the recent liquidation events on Aave V2 and V3 to analyze the impact of this downturn on the protocol.\nAave v3\nLiquidations\nIn the past 48 hours, liquidations totaling over $65 million took place, with a significant portion of $50 million, representing 77%, occurring within the last 24 hours alone. These liquidations involved 4,250 events across 1,858 unique accounts and were executed by 70 distinct liquidators.\n\n\nThe majority of liquidations, amounting to 70.6% or $46.9 million, took place on the Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n58.8% of all liquidations involved wstETH or WETH as collateral assets. Additionally, assets like AAVE and WAVAX saw a relatively high number of liquidations, accounting for 9.8% ($6.52 million) and 9.2% ($6.13 million), respectively.\n\nAs expected, 98.5% of debt assets were represented by various stablecoin iterations.\n\nAccount Size Distribution\nBelow, we illustrate the distribution of accounts liquidated over the last 48 hours, categorized by the size of the positions involved. Notably, the largest account amounted to $8.11 million, comprising a wstETH-collateralized USDC debt position.\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Size of Collateral Seized\nNumber of Accounts\nSum of Liquidated\n% of Total\n\n\n\n\n100K\n68\n54.85M\n84.3%\n\n\n500K\n18\n43.4M\n66.7%\n\n\n1M\n11\n37.9M\n58.3%\n\n\n2.5M\n7\n31.9M\n49%\n\n\n\nBad Debt\nAave V3 demonstrated exceptional efficiency over the last 48 hours, with minimal bad debt incurred, as evidenced in the chart below.\n\nAave V2\nSimilar to V3, V2 experienced over $24M in liquidations over the past 48 hours, with $15M, or 62.5%, happening within the last 24 hours. This involved 334 liquidation events across 245 unique accounts, executed by 31 unique liquidators.\n\n\nNaturally, the vast majority of liquidations occurred on Ethereum Mainnet, accounting for 99% or $23.8M of the total.\n\n98.4% of the seized collateral originated from WETH and stETH.\n\nSurprisingly, however, the vast majority of debt asset liquidations stemmed from WBTC debt, as can be seen below.\n\nThis originated from a single account that accounted for $21.9M in seized collateral, representing 91.25% of the total liquidation amount. Subsequently, this position has experienced a 30% reduction in value, leaving 17K ETH as collateral against 676 WBTC in debt.\nAccount Size Distribution\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Size of Collateral Seized\nNumber of Accounts\nSum of Liquidated\n% of Total\n\n\n\n\n50K\n7\n23.5M\n97.9%\n\n\n100K\n5\n23.4M\n97.5%\n\n\n500K\n2\n22.7M\n94.5%\n\n\n1M\n1\n21.9M\n91.25%\n\n\n\nBad Debt\nAave V2 worked incredibly efficiently over the last 48 hours, incurring minimal bad debt, as can be seen in the chart below.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, the Aave protocol demonstrated robust performance over the past 48 hours, with the current parameterization proving effective during this stress test.

We formed to be an objective resource because, at the time, it was a bull market; there was a new, exciting bribe market, and we realized a certain complacency and get-rich-quick mentality was overcoming good judgment that could have lasting consequences.

We have five full-time members and about a dozen analysts. Our team is fully distributed across America, Europe, and Asia.\n\n\n\n EzR3aL:\n\nIf approved by the DAO what would the collaboration between you and Chaos look like?\nFrom what I can read both of you are specialized in different fields.\n\n\nWe have a prior history wokring with Chaos Labs, with contracting them to develop a risk dashboard for crvUSD. We communicated with members of their team from onboarding until delivery of the product and have begun developing a good relationship with their team. We intend to work closely with them and provide support in areas where their resources are better spent elsewhere. That means we will produce qualitative collateral risk reports for assets backing GHO, including market and adoption analytics and technical, counterparty, and regulatory risk factors. This focus will allow Chaos Labs to dedicate more attention to quantitative analysis across the various chains Aave is deployed. LlamaRisk and Chaos Labs are aligned in our enthusiasm for collaboration, and we see this mutual attitude as a big opportunity to bring Aave\u2019s risk services to the next level.\n\n\n\n EzR3aL:\n\nAre you going to be Aave exclusive or also working for other lending protocols, for example also forks of Aave v2/3?\n\n\nWe continue to partner with Curve and plan to provide service for Curve Lending, particularly by developing a simulation tool for improved optimization and risk monitoring. LlamaRisk has never directly engaged with AAVE forks; we work with just a handful of protocols, most prominently Curve Finance and Prisma Finance. For full transparency, we have worked on aggregator vaults on behalf of Curve and Prisma, including strategy design and management and supporting contract development. These are initiatives to promote integrations of the crvUSD and mkUSD stablecoins, employing high transparency and risk management standards for which we have built a reputation. We have an active aggregator on Sturdy v2 with $5.7m in TVL currently and an upcoming vault on Morpho, both of which involve Curve LPs as collateral to borrow crvUSD.\nTo address potential concerns about how committed we are to our partners, consider that we have been partnered with Curve for the entire time we have operated and have yet to terminate an engagement with any of our partners. Loyalty is central to each protocol we partner with; it is not something we treat casually. Anyone can verify this by contacting the Curve and Prisma team (on Telegram if direct contacts are unavailable) and asking them how their experience working with LlamaRisk has been. We guarantee they will only have positive things to say. Rest assured that we will treat an engagement with Aave with the same dedication that has earned us the respect of our other partners.\n\n\n\n Frida:\n\nDo you have a high-level example of a low-hanging fruit you would tackle first? Or an aspect of Aave you would like to focus first? Clear examples would help to understand what some of the themes you outline in the Temp Check would look like.\n\n\nWe see potential to add immediate value in a few key areas:\n\nSupport GHO adoption: A particular focus will be put on the GHO stablecoin to review and assess the underlying collateral assets. We will also explore potential venues for further integration and adoption of GHO within the broader ecosystem. Our insights will help to ensure the stability and trust in GHO, supporting its wider use and acceptance.\nRegulatory Review: We offer unique expertise in providing regulatory reviews of Aave, which will complement Chaos Labs\u2019 quantitative analysis and serve as a component of multidisciplinary risk assessment. Our team will prioritize this area, adding significant value to the community. We can also explore delivering stand-alone updates on key regulatory changes to inform the community about the evolving landscape.\nEmpirical Research and Qualitative Risk Assessment: We will provide empirical research and qualitative risk assessment of assets in Aave\u2019s markets across various chains, analyzing factors like market dynamics, adoption, technical risks, and counterparty risks.\n\n\n\n\n Frida:\n\nWould there be a ramp-up plan if you were to be elected? How would that look like? Aave has many markets in different blockchains resulting in different risk profiles. Also, Chaos Labs (and prev Gauntlet as well) are part of different roles (I believe stewards or sth like that).\n\n\nAs a new contributor to the Aave ecosystem, we are excited to learn about the different governance processes, participating actors, and the overall structure of the protocol. While we have extensive experience interacting with various DAOs, we recognize that engaging directly with Aave governance will require some learning, and we are very keen to acquire this knowledge quickly. Note, however, that we do have extensive experience as Aave users; members of our team have interacted with the protocol and followed developments since as far back as early 2020.\nWe are committed to rapidly ramping up our participation in governance discussions, particularly in areas where our expertise can add significant value. Chaos Labs has generously offered support and guidance to facilitate our learning process, which will help us adapt and contribute effectively.\nOur ramp-up plan involves dedicating efforts to familiarize ourselves with Aave\u2019s governance structure and risk management frameworks.

With the above rate automation mechanism, it should only be necessary for keepers to update the interest rate model once per day or less, which should help limit gas costs; this is particularly important on mainnet but might be less of a concern on other chains/L2s such as Polygon PoS, Gnosis, Avalanche, Optimism or Arbitrum.\nImo the core goals for IRM automation should be maintaining market safety, improving efficiency (lower spread between borrow and supply rates, resulting from higher average market utilization rates), and less voting/governance/service provider overhead, while limiting cost of operation. If Adrastia oracles can achieve this with better precision / at comparable cost, this would make sense to use borrow/supply rate oracles rather than the proposed geometric mean rate evaluation mechanism.

A dynamic interest rate that can adjust in response to a number of factors could optimize capital efficiency in a manner that is equivalent to credit scoring, and also reduce risk caused by a dearth of available reserve liquidity.\nHowever, automated IR mechanisms do have their tradeoffs. We show in our research on dynamic rate curves that the deterministic nature of this automated IR mechanism - as evidenced by the constant nature of marginal increase/decrease in IR outside of the target utilization bounds - could introduce potential attack vectors analagous to JIT liquidity attacks for Uniswap. These attack vectors essentially allow for a strategic user to profit and seize higher yield at the expense of less sophisticated lenders. This over time may reduce overall liquidity on protocols, impairing the capital efficiency of the protocol. For instance,\n\nA strategic user adds a large amount of demand and raises utilization rates by opening borrow positions, causing the interest rate to spike dramatically.\nThe choice of how much of a spike was caused allows the strategic user to sequentially reduce demand (repaying a portion of the opened borrow) and increase supply in such a way that the interest rate and utilization are stationary.\nAfter a number of blocks, the strategic user returns the utilization to the level prior to opening loans.\n\n\nAt a high level, we find that the reducing the reserve factor below certain thresholds can negate attacker profitability. We have also identified that considering supply and demand elasticities may help with this IR param optimization, especially with the reserve factor and optimally balancing protocol revenue. As a result, models for these elasticities and/or their results can be fed into future automated IR mechanisms to make them more robust against potential attacks and manipulations and disincentivize adversarial actors.", "reads": 33, "readers_count": 32, "created": "2023-08-17T23:16:35.504Z"}], [{"topic_id": 14226, "post_id": 34186, "post_number": 2, "score": 10.2, "author_username": "ChaosLabs", "text": "As we\u2019ve already proposed here, we recommend increasing the USDT supply cap on V3 Ethereum to 300M.", "reads": 26, "readers_count": 25, "created": "2023-08-02T06:09:08.716Z"}, {"topic_id": 14226, "post_id": 34332, "post_number": 3, "score": 64.4, "author_username": "Gauntlet", "text": "We will move forward to increase USDT Supply cap to 300M and will implement Risk Steward actions shortly.", "reads": 22, "readers_count": 21, "created": "2023-08-03T14:55:15.287Z"}, {"topic_id": 14226, "post_id": 34413, "post_number": 4, "score": 4.0, "author_username": "ChaosLabs", "text": "This has been executed via Risk Steward.", "reads": 20, "readers_count": 19, "created": "2023-08-04T08:14:36.411Z"}], [{"topic_id": 14302, "post_id": 34410, "post_number": 2, "score": 39.2, "author_username": "ChaosLabs", "text": "As discussed, we\u2019re aligned here and support moving directly to AIP.", "reads": 46, "readers_count": 45, "created": "2023-08-04T07:37:38.542Z"}, {"topic_id": 14302, "post_id": 34412, "post_number": 3, "score": 38.4, "author_username": "0xkeyrock.eth", "text": "We are supportive of this proposal and being direct-to-AIP.", "reads": 42, "readers_count": 41, "created": "2023-08-04T08:14:20.846Z"}, {"topic_id": 14302, "post_id": 34433, "post_number": 4, "score": 51.8, "author_username": "Gauntlet", "text": "Gauntlet recommendation to lower CRV LT/LTV on v3 Polygon\nSummary\nGiven the declines in DEX liquidity for CRV and other associated risk factors for CRV, Gauntlet recommends reducing the LT, LTV for CRV on Polygon v3.\nFor expediency purposes and to prevent excess forced liquidations, we recommend reducing CRV LT from 75% to 65% and the LTV from 70% to 35%.\n\nAs of August 4, this causes 4 accounts to be liquidatable.\n\n\n\n\n\nuser_address\nsupply_balance_usd\nborrow_balance_usd\nhf\nhf_new\nsupplied_symbols\nborrowed_symbols\norig_lt\nnew_lt\n\n\n\n\n0x56df4b7996a0a96e09d31bd69d95fd29d0a2b3bd\n5031\n4158\n1.00\n0.97\n[\u2018USDC\u2019, \u2018CRV\u2019]\n[\u2018USDT\u2019, \u2018WBTC\u2019]\n0.75\n0.65\n\n\n0xf36375ef8ef450476541f6326631cac44f9f0a49\n65\n47\n1.05\n0.99\n[\u2018USDC\u2019, \u2018WETH\u2019, \u2018DAI\u2019, \u2018WBTC\u2019, \u2018CRV\u2019, \u2018WMATIC\u2019]\n[\u2018DAI\u2019, \u2018WBTC\u2019, \u2018CRV\u2019, \u2018WMATIC\u2019]\n0.75\n0.65\n\n\n0x68a4e84fec63e80b3978a69d64a09fd91ab16a59\n5\n3\n1.15\n0.99\n[\u2018CRV\u2019]\n[\u2018DAI\u2019]\n0.75\n0.65\n\n\n0x0d004dc793b724490b192002cd76ec0cf43ad87c\n3\n1\n1.00\n0.93\n[\u2018WMATIC\u2019, \u2018CRV\u2019]\n[\u2018EURS\u2019]\n0.75\n0.65\n\n\n\nReducing LT further may cause user 0x60a6d69802239e8678f35cf3cff8af6d64ab4088 to be liquidated.

I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts from the perspective of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI).\nFirstly, it\u2019s important to remember the core ethos of DeFi, which is neutrality. The protocol should function effectively regardless of whether a pool has one large position or a thousand smaller ones with similar liquidation ranges. The intention of users or what they do with their funds is not our primary concern. Users should be free to utilize the protocol as they see fit.\nSecondly, we need to be cautious about implementing \u201csolutions\u201d that could potentially do more harm than good. The user in question currently has a healthy Health Factor. Artificially increasing the odds of liquidation by increasing the Reserve Factor (RF) or lowering the Liquidation Threshold (LT) may not be the most sensible approach.\nLastly, we should generally encourage the use of Aave V3 over V2. One of the reasons this large position grew in V2 was due to overly conservative CRV parameters in V3, which prevented a seamless migration. V3 has caps that allow for more granular management, which is a significant advantage.\nIn conclusion, while we should certainly monitor and manage risks, it\u2019s crucial that we do so in a way that respects the principles of DeFi and the functionality of our protocol. In our opinion, there is not a significant need for governance to enforce any kind of action at this point.\nWe would like to clearly state that we will vote no to any rushed plan that just reacts to social media chatter.", "reads": 115, "readers_count": 114, "created": "2023-06-14T08:56:07.245Z"}, {"topic_id": 13644, "post_id": 32538, "post_number": 12, "score": 92.2, "author_username": "Jommi", "text": "Why is it an issue if a user has no intention of repaying the debt?

The top CRV account holds a massive position in a market starved of liquidity. If we agree that we\u2019re already knee-deep in exposure, a freeze at this stage is more of a token gesture than an effective strategy. It would only serve to handcuff an account that has historically shown sound management, hindering its ability to top up. Instead of cosmetic measures, we should zero in on impactful solutions involving additional LT reductions and increasing the RF with regard to CRV and broader V2 markets.\n\nAnalysis\nIn the context of the V2 framework, the scarcity of risk levers considerably narrows our operational capabilities. While freezing can offer some advantages, it concurrently presents potential obstacles. The upside is clear - freezing limits additional CRV risk exposure. However, a freeze could unintentionally trigger heightened levels of FUD, exacerbating the concern already sparked by this post and potentially accelerating a CRV depreciation. Following a freeze, account holders are precluded from topping up, and given the prevailing sparse market liquidity, the trajectory toward bad debt could be alarmingly precipitous.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that CRV\u2019s total supply has exceeded $100 million in markets with declining liquidity for over a year.\n\n354473450_1426877081408252_863655571873176780_n (1)2048\u00d71280 46.3 KB\n\n$CRV supplied to Aave has posed an asymmetrically large risk for at least the past 12 months.\n\n354054756_281517187668777_5781164131001018686_n (1)2048\u00d71299 30.1 KB\n\nThe opportune moment to propose a freeze was in the past. As of now, we\u2019re applying a superficial solution to a much deeper issue. Our simulations show potential bad debt amounting to tens of millions, given the unprofitability of liquidations due to insufficient liquidity. Although capping the exposure seems appealing now, it fails to address the core issue.\nHistorical analysis of the top position shows that the user has been active and has been protecting their wallet health over time.\n\nFreezing the market would block the user from doing so. Furthermore, we must acknowledge that a freeze, immobilizing large CRV positions, could incite significant market turbulence. In this regard, a new economic attack vector has surfaced, potentially creating a vulnerability for a speculative attack on the CRV token. Speculators recognizing this potential setup, particularly if well capitalized, are likely evaluating the risk-reward characteristics of mounting an Avi-style attack.  For stakeholders who maintain a long-term bullish stance on CRV and aim to maximize accumulation, this scenario, where the price could depreciate rapidly, presents an opportunity to repurchase at a considerable markdown; thus, such investors can be very patient in their accumulation plans due to the current unfolding series of events.\n\nConclusion\nAs reiterated throughout this discussion, the implementation of a freeze is a severe measure and should be reserved for scenarios where it has the potential to enact material impact. In the case of CRV, Aave has been in a state of overexposure for over a year, and the right time for a freeze was then. Although not fiercely against a freeze, at this moment in time, its impact will be negligible and potentially very counterproductive. The market is highly volatile, and the top account holder has consistently demonstrated active risk management and maintenance of their position\u2019s health. Regarding CRV, given V2\u2019s high vulnerability to market volatility, we advocate against freezing, especially given the top accounts\u2019 history of active risk management.

In light of this, we thought it would be helpful to provide more clarity on the rationale for freezing CRV.\nWhy does Gauntlet recommend freezing CRV on Aave v2?\nFreezing prevents the continued excessive buildup of CRV, preventing further concentration. We don\u2019t know how much CRV the user has on the backend that he can add to add this concentration.\n\n\nThe tradeoff is that user cannot use CRV to protect their position should it become liquidatable.\n\nThis is the point - freezing compels the user to either provide additional collateral or repay their debts. There is speculation that the user may be unable to access funds to repay their USDT debt, but this cannot be measured. It\u2019s important to note that the user has already started repaying a portion of their debt since the proposal was introduced.\n\n\n\nUnfrozen CRV incentivizes the user to protect their position by depositing CRV, which will add further concentration risk, rather than repaying their debt.\n\n\nWe cannot predict how liquidity and market conditions will evolve in the future, so we cannot assign a probability to this. Consequently, adding more CRV to this position will increase future risk. We want to avoid a situation where the position has a higher amount of CRV as collateral and the liquidity of CRV has further decreased, making it harder to remove the position.\n\nWhy do increases in CRV collateral add additional risk?\n\n\nIncreases in CRV collateral add insolvency risk linearly with respect to the marginal increase in CRV position, which can be superproportional with respect to the original position. In other words, increasing the CRV position by x% can increase insolvencies by MORE THAN x%.\n\n\nGiven the user\u2019s current position, suppose there was an initial CRV price drop that forces the user to adjust their positions, and the user needs to either repay USDT debt or refill CRV collateral to maintain a \u201csafe\u201d HF. For example - suppose the user\u2019s target HF is 1.6, and CRV drops 16%. That means the user\u2019s HF has dropped to 1.4 (supply 288m CRV, borrow 62m USDT, CRV price $0.62, current data as of 2023/06/16 23:30 UTC). This implies the user either needs to repay 7.7m USDT or deposit 41m CRV to return the HF to 1.6. The following heat map shows the relationship of increased insolvencies between adding CRV collateral vs repaying USDT debt when HF is held constant, to the CRV price drop and the amount of additional CRV added.\n\n\n\nLet the initial drop be drop_init (the above example is 16%). Then the user\u2019s default insolvencies, assuming liquidations occur after the price has stabilized after a big drop of x%, are\n\n\n\nThe user\u2019s insolvencies after repaying are\n\n\n\nThis implies that the insolvency is linear with respect to how much CRV we refill, and by how much CRV price drops by\n\n\nThe user\u2019s insolvencies after refilling with CRV are the same as the user\u2019s default insolvencies since USD balances remain the same.\n\n\nTherefore, refilling relative to repaying debt can increase final insolvencies by 1/(1-drop_init) - 1, which is the same as the CRV refill amount.\n\n\n\n\nLiquidations will mostly occur once the price has stabilized, if the stabilized price is lower than -70%, liquidations will drive the account towards realized insolvency. HF is currently 1.7, and currently, CRV needs to decrease by 40% to trigger liquidations and 70% to trigger insolvencies. Our simulations show that there is current liquidity levels can only support ~$6m in liquidation as CRV decreases in price. Drawing parallels to USDC depeg, liquidity deteriorates as CRV price drops, thresholding liquidation volume. Only when the price stabilizes and begins to trend flat does liquidation volume increase.\n\nAs a result, final_price(CRV) stabilizes at a price less than the min_price_no_insolvency(CRV), any liquidation will continue to drive the HF downwards. Moreover, if increased CRV supply from refills can continue to exert downward pressure on the stabilized CRV price, so the more CRV refill/supply, the lower the effective liquidation price could be and the greater the harm to the user HF.\nTo illustrate the potential speed of liquidations, during the previous CRV incident on 2022-11-22, 50m of CRV debt was repaid in 1 hr of time as CRV went from 0.61 to 0.71.\n\n\n\nThe user has the capacity to greatly increase their CRV position. For context, the user\u2019s CRV position has doubled over the past half year. The user has roughly 150m CRV on other lending platforms, and 60m CRV unlock in the next year, which means he has the capacity to potentially increase their Aave v2 position by almost 70%.\n\n\n\n\nOn preventing borrow from increasing\n\nThis was our intention behind setting LTV to 0, and we look forward to improvements across Aave v2 to make that check more rigorous and non-circumventable. As we previously discussed, managing the user\u2019s position requires addressing both sides of the problem. This involves preventing further supply growth and restricting the user from borrowing more in order to minimize risk.\n\n\nOn freezing being too extreme\n\nThis is the philosophical problem of DeFi - Gauntlet is looking to absolutely minimize bad debt on Aave that can result from market risk. At times, the best course of action is to intervene in a fairly extreme manner, similar to our pause suggestions during the USDC depeg. As DeFi gets more developed, we look forward to new automated, algorithmic mechanisms that serve as killswitches to stop normal behavior in abnormal events.\n", "reads": 87, "readers_count": 86, "created": "2023-06-20T16:16:25.794Z"}], [], [{"topic_id": 13147, "post_id": 31187, "post_number": 2, "score": 13.8, "author_username": "MarcZeller", "text": "Hello @IncentiveLord and thanks for publishing a proposal.\n\n\nARC process has been deprecated, is this proposal a temp check or a ARFC? following governance guidelines a TEMP CHECK for offboarding would be more fit.\n\n\nAave is a decentralized & permissionless protocol, an offboarding can\u2019t happen overnight as the protocol can\u2019t (and thxfully) touch user positions, are you advocating for a freeze that will remove the capabilities to have any additional deposits & borrows of this asset? followed by a offboarding plan making deposit unattractive via modified risk parameters and reserveFactor?\n\n\nMAI is present since a long time on Polygon market, are you targeting MAI in general or only MAI on Arb & optimism?\n\n\nThe ACI is not in favor of this proposal as we\u2019re supportive of stablecoin diversity and do not consider MAI as a particularly risky asset for the protocol. but if this proposal reach support on TEMP CHECK snapshot stage, we will assist with ARFC & AIP stage following our policy to support aave governance.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I own QI & vQI representing a small portion of my portfolio.", "reads": 44, "readers_count": 43, "created": "2023-05-20T13:59:03.300Z"}, {"topic_id": 13147, "post_id": 31188, "post_number": 3, "score": 18.4, "author_username": "IncentiveLord", "text": "Thanks @MarcZeller for the reply.\n\n\nThis is one of my first governance contributions.

Based on our analysis, we recommend increasing the Loan-To-Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold (LT) for WBTC and DAI, as we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support significant liquidations. Similarly, we recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty for WBTC, which is set conservatively at 10% to a lower level (8.5%) closer to that of USDC and Ethereum (5%).\nPositions Analysis\nWe have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations. However, we should call out that  ~40% of the on-chain supply of WBTC on Optimism is currently held on Aave, which calls for some caution. We have already proposed and implemented an amendment to the supply cap to limit the concentration of liquidity on Aave.\nGiven the blue-chip nature of BTC/WBTC, we expect significant arbitrage buying pressure to offset any slippage that may be created by future liquidations of WBTC and, therefore, recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty even with the current significant liquidity concentration on Aave. We expect a lower LP to drive liquidators to liquidate positions in smaller portions, pacing the process and allowing the market more time to react.\nRecommendations\n\n\n\n\nAsset\nParameter\nCurrent\nRecommended\nChange\n\n\n\n\nWBTC\nLiquidation Threshold\n75%\n78%\n+3%\n\n\nWBTC\nLoan-to-Value\n70%\n73%\n+3%\n\n\nWBTC\nLiquidation Penalty\n10%\n8.5%\n-1.5%\n\n\nDAI\nLiquidation Threshold\n80%\n83%\n+3%\n\n\nDAI\nLoan-to-Value\n75%\n78%\n+3%\n\n\n\nNext Steps\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and will follow up with a Snapshot vote in 5 days, barring community objection.\n\n\n** *\n\nemphasized text\n\n", "reads": 15, "readers_count": 14, "created": "2023-05-05T09:40:19.134Z"}], [{"topic_id": 12385, "post_id": 28981, "post_number": 2, "score": 93.2, "author_username": "ChaosLabs", "text": "Thanks for putting forward this proposal @seawolf.\nWe would like to flag that there is a proposal to update supply and borrow caps on V3 Avalanche, which was already approved by the community and will be executed by the Guardians shortly.\nA table with the approved caps highlighted is shared below for visibility\n\nScreen Shot 2023-03-20 at 10.24.15 PM1634\u00d7516 64 KB\n\nGiven the changes in on-chain liquidity on Avalanche, we support the update for USDC and DAI.e.

Particularly, these assets do not require merchants or special fees to redeem and withdraw, they can be easily bridged.\n\n\nThis decision was made after Gauntlet\u2019s analysis of the situation and considering various factors, which are detailed below. Extreme price movements can cause insolvencies in the protocol.\nApproximately ~70% of all liquidations on Avalanche immediately trade out of their position. All of the BTC.b liquidations (13 total greater than 1,000 USD) in the last month immediately trade out of their positions. See these examples 1, 2, 3. That is the basis of considering on-chain liquidity for setting borrow and supply caps at this moment. The learning from the USDC price deviation was that DEX liquidity is a NECESSARY condition for liquidations on Aave V3 Avalanche. This condition seems to hold for BTC.b as well. By lowering the caps, we aim to mitigate the risk of price manipulation attacks and protect the protocol\u2019s growth. The cap we set relative to market caps is balanced to defend against attacks while still allowing for revenue generation.\n\nVolume of bridged assets vs non-bridged assets: A significant amount of bridged assets like DAI.e left the ecosystem in comparison to non-bridged assets like USDT and USDC. This indicated a heightened level of risk and warranted a more conservative approach to managing the lending protocol.\nRecall that our borrow and supply caps serve to protect the protocol from price manipulation attacks, with liquidity being a key factor in the calculations. Please note the net outflows in BTC.b below.\n\nAverage time to bridge: The time taken to bridge assets is crucial in times of duress. Per the Avalanche docs, on average, it takes 1 hour to bridge to Avalanche from the Bitcoin network, and 20 minutes from Ethereum. Our aggressive recommendations take into account global liquidity, including liquidity in centralized exchanges. However, for bridged assets, this may hinder healthy liquidations from occuring during black swan events. By lowering the caps, we aim to encourage instantaneous liquidations and improve the stability of the protocol.\n\n\n\n\n luigidemeo88:\n\nIn my opinion and specifically in reference to the proposed changes to BTC.b, WETH.e, DAI.e, this is a pretty draconian measure for assets that have very little to do with the USDC depegging event.\n\n\nLowering DAI.e caps was a pertinent response to the depeg, as during the event, the asset dropped 8% in price and resulted in $324K liquidated on the protocol (and a relatively small amount of insolvencies). As mentioned, in the process, a majority of the DAI.e liquidations instantaneously traded out of their positions. By reducing the caps, we aim to provide a more stable and secure lending environment, ensuring the long-term success and growth of the Avalanche Aave v3 lending protocol.\nPlease refer to our Supply and Borrow Cap Methodology for a detailed explanation of the factors considered in setting these caps. As this is a response to a crisis, we had opted to use conservative caps that reference only on-chain liquidity. Moreover, as outlined in this methodology, we propose slightly higher aggressive caps for some bridged assets in order to promote protocol usage and asset growth; however, this is secondary to protecting the protocol in times of volatility. We will continue to monitor liquidity conditions and make recommendations as they evolve.\nA Note on LSTs\n\n\n\n luigidemeo88:\n\nLSDs and redeemable assets such as BTC.b cannot be viewed in the same lens as native assets.\n\n\nWith respect to LSTs such as sAVAX, we had not recommended changes to sAVAX post-depeg, as the liquidity had widely recovered.

Our risk analysis did not yield a strong view on the proposed LINK or WAVAX changes. However, we did want to flag the changes for BTC.b and WETH.e. Gauntlet cautions against increasing LT/LTV for BTC.b and decreasing the LT/LTV for WETH.e.\n\nGauntlet Recommendations\nGauntlet\u2019s analysis disagrees with increasing LT/LTV for BTC.b and decreasing the LT/LTV for WETH.e. Given that in this instance, the current supply for BTC.b (3700) has considerably exceeded both Gauntlet\u2019s conservative (900) and aggressive caps (2800), increasing the LT for BTC.b and decreasing the LT for WETH.e adds risk to less liquid / whale-concentrated assets, decreases the borrowing power of safer and more liquid assets on Avalanche, and has negligible impact on increased borrows and protocol revenue.\n\nIn the event borrow usage increases disproportionately, the onchain liquidity for these collateral assets may not be able to support their liquidation potential.\nThese assets\u2019 borrow usage suggests these LT changes will have a negligible impact on protocol revenue (~$925).\n\nAnalyzing onchain liquidity provides insight into the risks here. Suppose borrow usage with these assets as collateral actually increases disproportionately (a tail risk that we aim to protect against). Consider the event in which the largest suppliers for each asset decide to maximally borrow against their collateral (which is a possible, permissible action in the protocol). Essentially, we aim to evaluate the \u2018potential harm\u2019 this user may cause. Consider the slippage that results from a liquidation sized at this max borrow, adjusted for the initial close factor of 50%.\n\nBTC.b, largest supplier 0xd275e5cb559d6dc236a5f8002a5f0b4c8e610701\n$28.6mm \u2192 max borrow, adjusted for close factor is ~$10mm\n(Also note that 60% of BTC.b supply is on Aave)\n\n\n\nWETH, largest supplier $9mm \u2192 max borrow, adjusted for close factor is ~$3.3mm\n\n\nAs shown above, the slippage for BTC.b is meaningfully higher than WETH.e for the respective largest suppliers.\nEven though the marginal slippage corresponding to respective LT increases of 3% of the current supply may be acceptably small, BTC.b has the latent potential to become a high VAR asset due to the strong whale presence. Moreover, 60% of the BTC.b circulating supply on Avalanche is supplied in Aave already.\nThe largest historical liquidations on Aave v3 Avalanche have been < $200k in size. Gauntlet is researching the distribution of liquidations that use on-chain liquidity vs. liquidations that use global liquidity. Until we find sufficient evidence to the contrary, we should not assume a larger base of liquidity (global liquidity) for potential large liquidations that have never historically happened before and should rely solely on on-chain liquidity.\nNext, let\u2019s analyze the borrow usage (taken from the Chaos dashboard, as of ~2/12/2023)-\n\nWETH.e has borrow usage of 46%, BTC.b has 37.8%, LINK.e has 26.5%, WAVAX has 13.8%.\n\nAfter adjusting for asset CF -\n\nWETH.e has borrow usage of 47%, BTC.b has 45%, LINK.e has 34%, WAVAX has 15%.\n\nSome of the supplied collateral is unproductive, as in changes to the LT should not rationally impact borrower behavior -\n\nFor instance, roughly 30% of BTC.b borrow is recursive - any additional BTC.b borrow with BTC.b supply is not profitable relative to nonrecursive borrowing. So rationally, this BTC.b supply would not have new associated borrow and is thus non productive.\n\nAssuming users will maintain their (debt / max debt) ratio, where max debt is the maximum debt they can take on with their current supply, we find that the BTC.B LT change could increase borrows by roughly $900k, while the WETH.e LT change decreases borrows by $525k. This is the breakdown by debt (borrow) asset when aggregated together -\n\nwhich is roughly $370k increase in borrows. At current variable borrow rates of roughly 2.5%, with a 10% RF, this amounts to ~$925 in added protocol revenue per year.\n\nTLDR;\nUltimately, increasing LT of BTC.b while decreasing the LT of WETH.e enables excess risk to less liquid / whale-concentrated assets and only has a small potential benefit on protocol revenue.", "reads": 40, "readers_count": 39, "created": "2023-02-14T18:54:08.208Z"}, {"topic_id": 11603, "post_id": 27694, "post_number": 3, "score": 81.4, "author_username": "ChaosLabs", "text": "Thanks, @Pauljlei, for sharing Gauntlet\u2019s detailed analysis.\nThis analysis highlights an important topic: assumptions around future user behavior and risk amongst markets that are \u201cwhale-concentrated.\u201d\nWe believe that \u201cwhale-centric\u201d liquidity distribution across different networks is common enough to warrant a discussion regarding the community\u2019s appetite for risk.\nWe are proponents of selecting the risk-off approach in any dilemma while driving discussions that solicit community feedback.

However, the current state is a market distortion that was caused as a result of there being no cap for AAVE on Optimism. Practically, if this single position highlighted above were to be closed, the recommended supply cap would be around 40% above the current supply, which is very reasonable from a usability perspective.\n\nAnalysis of AAVE token supply on Optimism\nWhen observing the accounts that supply AAVE tokens to AAVE V3 on Optimism we have identified a single account supplied 79k AAVE position, 87% of total supply, at current health of  ~1.6.\n\nAAVEOPT11430\u00d7884 146 KB\n\n\nThe approach to setting the supply cap for AAVE tokens on Optimism\nThis amount cannot be liquidated with the current AAVE liquidity on Optimism. While this account is an active, healthy account, it is still a risk for the protocol that should have been avoided had supply caps been in place.  Therefore, the approach we took was to set the supply cap using the methodology according to the distribution of the other accounts, excluding the account with the biggest position. The reasoning behind this is that while this position is open, there is risk exposure that we cannot mitigate without forcing liquidation of the position. Therefore, the best approach would be to set appropriate risk parameters that will secure the protocol if this position is closed.\n\nAAVEOPT21334\u00d7816 143 KB\n\n\nUntitled (13)2400\u00d71580 234 KB\n\n\nThe recommended Supply Cap\nBased on the approach described above, our simulations have produced r=0.278, which yields: (currentSupply - supply of 0x36..a8a)/r*marketCapFactor =  10k / 0.278 * 0.39 = 14K.\nOur recommendation is to set the Supply Cap for AAVE tokens on Optimism at 14K.\nWhile this cap effectively pauses AAVE supply, until the position opened by 0x36c4bd54d54dd898c242f5f634f5d0cef3be2a8a is closed, we believe it is the appropriate cap that will secure AAVE V3 on Optimism.", "reads": 53, "readers_count": 52, "created": "2023-01-01T22:46:29.473Z"}, {"topic_id": 11213, "post_id": 25964, "post_number": 3, "score": 49.4, "author_username": "fig", "text": "There are a lot of variances between these two recommendations - 100,000 vs. 14,000\nBefore heading to a vote, I\u2019d love to see further discussions between these two managers to help the community distill which direction is best.\nAnother option is to initiate a modified Snapshot with both options:\n\n\n\nAdjust supply cap to 100,000 AAVE\n\n\nAdjust supply cap to 14,000 AAVE\n\n\nNAY - do not adjust\n\n\nAbstain\n\n\n\nWe want to ensure the proper risk management efforts are achieved promptly and hope to help facilitate this.", "reads": 47, "readers_count": 46, "created": "2023-01-03T15:40:08.813Z"}, {"topic_id": 11213, "post_id": 25969, "post_number": 4, "score": 34.4, "author_username": "ChaosLabs", "text": "Thanks for this response @fig. Effective communication between risk managers is crucial to increase community clarity and a better understanding of proposals. We have been working on a proposed framework for risk manager collaboration which we plan to post later this week for community feedback.\nRegarding the proposals:\nThe main reason for the conservative figure on our proposal is that we did not assume liquidity bridging in our methodology and recommendation - it was based solely on the current liquidity levels in Optimism.\nGiven the assumption of bridging liquidity, the recommendation made by Gauntlet is reasonable. However, the proposal needs to include on-chain data or analyses to support it, leaving us uncomfortable relying on theoretical actor rationality. We urge Gauntlet to share any supporting data used in this analysis, as this will help inform the community about this decision.\nAdditionally, if other chains are indeed considered for liquidations, what methodology or heuristic was used to determine the 100k figure?

I don\u2019t think 14k is crazy - though it does freeze the growth of the market as @ChaosLabs points out.\nThe issue here is that if we were to apply the same logic across the board, it would likely more or less freeze all assets on Optimism as there is not great on-chain liquidity for the other assets as well. That is to say - following the logic you delineate here, we would likely have to set lower caps for all of the assets on Optimism.\nOur goal is to propose a set of caps to the community next week that would allow the community to decide \u201cDo we want to bet on cross-chain liquidity here?\u201d If the answer is yes, then we can likely move forward with caps that look more like the current ones, as opposed to caps that instant freeze new deposits for assets. However, if the answer is no, then this amounts to winding down the Optimism market quite a bit, which we know was a market the community was betting on from a growth perspective.\nI\u2019d prefer that we make this decision for the community as easy as possible. Instead of setting a conservative AAVE supply cap as a one-off, our goal was to set one quickly to limit risk increasing in the market and then follow up with conservative supply caps for all assets next week.\nThis path should make the decision making for the community as clear as possible - it\u2019s sometimes hard for people to weigh in on individual parameters like the supply cap for one asset on one market.

What\u2019s important here is the available liquidity within the range, such that the slippage is smaller than the liquidation penalty.\nBecause the liquidation penalty of WBTC is significantly higher than WETH, there is more liquidity available within that range, giving us more flexibility in terms of profitable liquidations for liquidators.\nWhile DEX Liquidity and liquidation penalties are critical factors in determining supply caps, they are not the only consideration. Our analysis shows that the pace of liquidations for ETH is faster than that of BTC (under relevant market conditions); therefore it will be harder for liquidators to liquidate underwater positions over time during adverse market events.\n\nWe\u2019ve validated this model with significant market actors and liquidity providers. Of course, these are all heuristics; but, we choose to over-index on the side of caution.\nSupply caps will be an iterative process that reflects market conditions and overall supply utilization. We believe it\u2019s best to be prudent during these times, as we can quickly raise supply caps moving forward as the market evolves and permits.\nFixed a few more links along the way.

Clearly it is a good start in assessing one part of the risks that Aave is exposed to. I also see that there has been tremendous and impressive work by the Risk Community in Aave. I have read what I have been able to find in this risk documentation and other areas. It is clear that this is a topic genuinely considered and taken seriously.\nI do have some questions about the overall risks and it would be really helpful if someone knows the answers. I am from a background in money and risk (I am an actuary) but I am fairly new to Blockchain so I am sorry if I am asking anything silly.\n\n\nIs there an overall Aave Risk Register that records the risks that have been identified with their likely occurrence and impact and the approach taken to mitigate, avoid, accept or transfer? Both in terms of the protocol and our customers.\n\n\nThe report lists four categories of risk: Security risk, Governance risk, Oracle risk, and Market risk and others are mentioned elsewhere. But are there others that are not covered by these categories? For example Regulatory risk, Reputation risk (both for Aave and for Crypto in general), Ethical risk, Operational risk, etc. I can also see other categories have been considered by the Risk Community too. Has any work been done to create a list of all the risk categories and thought given to how to manage the categories?\n\n\nWhat levers have been identified for controlling risks? Are these documented and who has control over them? What is the consensus mechanism for moving these levers?\n\n\nIs the Gauntlet software open source so that others can check their findings and perform peer reviews on their results? Using open source software tools encourages decentralization and promotes trust.\n\n\nThere are types of risks borne by customers that are not borne by Aave for example Insurance Risk if they stake in the Insurance Pool. Should we consider if we have a duty of care towards customers to identify, manage, and communicate these risk and if so how do we approach their risks? For example has there been any modelling to understand the expected Insurance Pool return? How much do returns vary? Is this positive in the long-run? If so do we know what this is and should it be communicated to customers? If it is negative what needs to change? What is the probability of large losses? Do customers understand what they are investing into and can they cope with possible losses?\n\n\nDoes the Aave Community know what its acceptable risk tolerances are both in terms of the Protocol and in terms of customer outcomes? What level of liquidations in terms of numbers and amounts, over say a one year time horizon is acceptable? Has this been communicated to customers so they know what risk they are taking on? There seems to be focus on ensuring the protocol survives \u2013 which is obviously a good outcome and completely the right place to start. But it is kind of the minimum to achieve as a foundation.\n\n\nHas any consideration been given to varying the Risk Thresholds by size of the customer\u2019s deposit? Perhaps it should start high and reduce as the size of the deposit increases?\n\n\nHas any thought been given to vulnerable customers? For example people who are in difficult personal circumstances and or who do not know what they are doing and could lose money that they need. Or customers who may suffer from personal, mental or addiction issues? Is Aave producing good outcomes for these customers and their families?\n\n\nThank you very much for taking time to read my questions and hopefully there are answers to at least some of them.
